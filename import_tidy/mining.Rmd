## General

* A schema is a blueprint for storing data. For a table every row has same number of columns, and each column is of the same type.

* conda create -n yourenvname python=x.x anaconda

* [Temp Pandas Columns](https://github.com/jreback/PyDataNYC2015/blob/master/whats-new-in-pandas/v0.16.x.ipynb)

* Sampling a massive CSV file:

    * pip install subsample

    * gzcat ginormous.csv.gz | subsample -n 100000 > sampled.csv.gz

## SQL

* CSV to DB V1: 

    * $ sqlite3 db_name.db
    * sqlite> .mode csv db_name
    * sqlite> .import data.csv db_name
    
* [CSV to DB V2](https://gist.github.com/gfleetwood/c2ea91da4a8ab1a77f777e28e0b2949c)

SQL joins allow you to combine two datasets side-by-side, but UNION allows you to stack one dataset on top of the other. Note that UNION only appends distinct values. More specifically, when you use UNION, the dataset is appended, and any rows in the appended table that are exactly identical to rows in the first table are dropped. If you’d like to append all the values from the second table, use UNION ALL

* List tables: SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';

* Show columns: .headers ON

CAST(column_name AS integer)
Note that you should not include an alias when you write a subquery in a conditional statement. 
ROW_NUMBER(), RANK() and DENSE_RANK()
NOW() + INTERVAL 
artist IS NULL
artist IS NOT NULL
song_name NOT ILIKE '%a%': case insensitive
ORDER BY year DESC, year_rank
COUNT(DISTINCT month)
count(col_name_or_col_index) returns count of non-null values like table in R
The CASE statement is followed by at least one pair of WHEN and THEN statements:
CASE WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'yes' ELSE NULL END
You can also define a number of outcomes in a CASE statement by including as many WHEN/THEN statements as you’d like

If you include two (or more) columns in a SELECT DISTINCT clause, your results will contain all of the unique pairs of those two columns

Can use AND right after JOIN to filter before joining. Using WHERE filters after joining.



## Scraping

* Access robots.txt: website_url.domain/robots.txt

* Tips: 1) Use bot net, 2) user agent switching

* Try polling in your wait about every 500 milliseconds. Also use presence of element located. I generally have better luck with that expected condition than visibility. Also, submit the search using the search button.

* Selenium: save_screenshot, forward(), back(), maximize(), use action_chains to do stuff like scroll find_element_by_link_name, element_to_be_clickable, visibility_of_element_located

```{python}
from pyvirtualdisplay import Display  
from selenium import webdriver  
display = Display(visible=0, size=(800, 600))  
display.start()  
browser = webdriver.Firefox()  
browser.get('http://www.google.com')  
print browser.title
