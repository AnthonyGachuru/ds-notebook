# Import & Tidy

## Import

* cross apply = inner join | outer apply = full join

* sql: SELECT 'Dummy Column Text' as DUMMYCOL FROM tbl

* In tidy data:
    * Each variable forms a column.
    * Each observation forms a row.
    * Each type of observational unit forms a table.

* A schema is a blueprint for storing data. For a table every row has same number of columns, and each column is of the same type.

* [json normalize](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.io.json.json_normalize.html)

* [Temporary pandas Columns](https://github.com/jreback/PyDataNYC2015/blob/master/whats-new-in-pandas/v0.16.x.ipynb)

* Sampling a massive CSV file:

    * pip install subsample

    * gzcat ginormous.csv.gz | subsample -n 100000 > sampled.csv.gz
    
* Make codebooks

## SQL

* CSV to DB V1: 
    * $ sqlite3 db_name.db
    * sqlite> .mode csv db_name
    * sqlite> .import data.csv db_name
    
* [CSV to DB V2](https://gist.github.com/gfleetwood/c2ea91da4a8ab1a77f777e28e0b2949c)

* SQL UNION stacks one dataset on top of the other. It only appends distinct values. More specifically, when you use UNION, the dataset is appended, and any rows in the appended table that are exactly identical to rows in the first table are dropped. If you’d like to append all the values from the second table, use UNION ALL.

* COUNT(DISTINCT month): returns count of non-null values like table in R

* The CASE statement is followed by at least one pair of WHEN and THEN statements: CASE WHEN year = 'SR' THEN 'yes' ELSE NULL END. You can also define a number of outcomes in a CASE statement by including as many WHEN/THEN statements as you’d like

* If you include two (or more) columns in a SELECT DISTINCT clause, your results will contain all of the unique pairs of those two columns

## Tidy

* Make data tidy: See tidy data paper

* [Optimal Bins For Histogram](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/798/calculating-optimal-number-of-bins-in-a-histogram/862#862)

* **The Coefficient of Unalikeability**: Unalikeability is defined as how often observations differ from one another. It varies from 0 to 1. The higher the value, the more unalike the data are.
