# Communicate, Deploy, Maintain

To cover these considerations, we recommend a structure similar to the following: 

1. Summarize the motivation behind the project, and its goals. It should either be an executive summary or a technical abstract.

2. State the project’s results.   

3. Back up the results with details, as needed. 

4. Discuss recommendations, outstanding issues, and possible future work.

For an end user presentation, we recommend a structure similar to the following: 

1. Summarize the motivation behind the project, and its goals.       

2. Show how the model fits into the users’ workflow (and how it improves that workflow).                                             
3. Show how to use the model.
