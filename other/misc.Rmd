## Python

* isin and crosstab functions pandas

* The only float that isn't equal to itself is nan.

* %matplotlib notebook: interactive plots

* Python memory storage: use pd.copy to create a deep copy instead of a shallow copy

* %who or %whos shows defined variables & %reset resets them

* %run script.py: func? prints out func doc

* Append dict to df, use ignore_index = True. eg. films_df = films_df.append(film_dict, ignore_index=1)

* np: fromfile, genfromtxt

* import pdb; pdb.set_trace(), 

* import sqlite3 + con = sqlite3.connect(':memory:')

* gs = GridSearchCV(estimator = pipe_svc, param)grid = param_grid, scoring = 'accuracy', cv = 5)

* scores = cross_val_score(gs, X, y, scoring = 'accuracy', cv = 5)

* dir() gives a list of in scope variables. globals() gives a dictionary of global variables. locals() gives a dictionary of local variables

## R

* rm(objectlist): Remove one or more objects from the workspace

* rm(list = ls()): Remove all objects in the current workspace

* cut(): Transform a numeric variable into a categorical variable.

* installr: update r in windows

* car: recode (good for dummying)

* Examine the objects in the workspace: ls.str()

* Use bloom::glance to look at model objects.

* This is how you dynamically update a value in Rmarkdown: x = *backtick* r x *backtick*.

stringr: matches, contains, starts_with

dplyr has five main actions that you can perform on a data frame. You can select columns, filter rows, arrange the order of rows, change columns or add new columns, and calculate summary statistics.

## Git

* Add upstream to update a forked repo with the original: remote add upstream repo_url 

* To undo git add . use git reset (no dot)

* git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=10000000'

* Update chnages from original repo, put in new branch: git fetch upstream

* Merge the upstream chnages to master on your local machine: git merge upstream/master

* Update local repo with master changes: git pull origin master

git diff (--cache) | git rm --cached 't.py' //remove from staging area

git show version_name + git branch (--merged, --no-merged) + git merge fix20

never rebase commits to public repo + rebase: branch working with behind in commit

use revert (change commit and log the change) + dont use reset: erases commit and doesnt log.

get fork url use: git clone url + git remote add upstream url: ref original repo

git fetch upstream: pull changes fro original repo + git push origin master: push stuff to clone

git merge upstream/master: merge github and local + make pull request, send pull request

Reset: Move master and working directory.

Revert: Less harsh version of reset, maintains commit history but moves forward by one from most recent commit.
