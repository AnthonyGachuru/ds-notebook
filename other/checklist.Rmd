### Import 

Step 0: Figure out what I’m trying to do with the data

Step 1: See what it looks out

So the first thing I do is fool around a bit to try to figure out what the data set “looks” like by doing things like what does looking at the types of variables I have, what the first few observations and last few observations look like.

If the data set is really big, I usually take a carefully chosen random subsample to make it possible to do my exploration interactively

 missing values or outliers

 summary() 

### Tidy

### Transform

### Visualize 

To compare the distributions of variables I usually use overlayed density plots 

I make tons of scatterplots to look at relationships between variables

Step 3: Plot. That. Stuff. After getting a handle with mostly text based tables and output (things that don’t require a graphics device)

Usually color/size the dots in the scatterplots by other variables to see if I can identify any confounding relationships that might screw up analyses downstream. Then, if the data are multivariate, I do some dimension reduction to get a feel for high dimensional structure. Nobody mentioned principal components or hierarchical clustering in the Twitter conversation, but I end up using these a lot to just figure out if there are any weird multivariate dependencies I might have missed.
