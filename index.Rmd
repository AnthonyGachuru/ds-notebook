# Workflow 

## Preamble

A typical data science workflow can be framed as following these steps:

* Business: start with a business question, define the goal and measure of success

* Data: find, access and explore the data

* Features: extract, assess and evaluate, select and sort

* Models: find the right model for the problem at hand, compare, optimize, and fine tune

* Communication: Interpret and communicate the results

* Production: transform the code into production ready code, integrate into current ecosystem and deploy

* Maintain: adapt the models and features to the evolution of the environment

Another instantiation via Hadley Wickham is:  import -> tidy -> understand [ transform <-> visualize <-> model ] -> communicate. As an abbreviation: ittvmcmd.

And the two combined: preparation -> import -> tidy -> understand [ transform <-> visualize <-> model ] -> [communicate + deploy + maintain]

What lies below is a succinct version of a workflow. Theoretical specifics can be found in other sections of this collection of cribsheets, and libraries or packages to use not included in the Stack can be found on this [page](https://gfleetwood.github.io/noted-resources/data_science.html).
