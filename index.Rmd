# Workflow 

## Preamble

A typical data science workflow can be framed as following these steps:

* Business: start with a business question, define the goal and measure of success

* Data: find, access and explore the data

* Features: extract, assess and evaluate, select and sort

* Models: find the right model for the problem at hand, compare, optimize, and fine tune

* Communication: Interpret and communicate the results

* Production: transform the code into production ready code, integrate into current ecosystem and deploy

* Maintain: adapt the models and features to the evolution of the environment

More succinctly, as per Hadley Wickham:

import -> tidy -> understand [ transform <-> visualize <-> model ] -> communicate

My combination of the two:

preparation -> import -> tidy -> understand [ transform <-> visualize <-> model ] -> [communicate + deploy + maintain]

Another note is that one way to structure projects is to write user stories a la software engineering. 

What lies below is a succinct version of a workflow. Theoretical specifics can be found in other sections of this collection of cribsheets, and libraries or packages to use not included in the Stack can be found on this [page](https://gfleetwood.github.io/noted-resources/data_science.html).

## Annotated Checklist

### Preparation

* Understand the business question, goals, and measures of success

* See if the data to answer the question exists, and if it is useful.

* Structure project as user stories

* Initialize report to track and summarise work and to do list.

* Remember to use atomic commit messages

### Import

* Character Encoding Precendence: utf-8, iso-8859-1, utf-16

* Sampling from data if its too large:  [subsample package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/subsample) in Python, [sqldf library](https://stackoverflow.com/a/22262726/6627726) in R
    
* [Sqlite Converter](https://github.com/thombashi/sqlitebiter)

* [Easy Database Management](https://dataset.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

* [Writing sql in pandas](https://github.com/yhat/pandasql)

### Tidy

* [Follow tidy data principles](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). widyr, tidyr, dplyr in R and pandas in Python.

* Figure out what you're trying to do with the data.

* See what the data looks like: types of variables, the first and last few observations, missing values or outliers. [xray](https://blog.datascienceheroes.com/x-ray-vision-on-your-datasets/), [skimr](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/skimr), [xda](https://github.com/ujjwalkarn/xda), and [janitor](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/introduction.html) in R. pandas and scipy.stats.describe() in Python.

* Outlier Detection: interquartile range, kernel density estimation, bonferroni test

### Transform

* library(DataExplorer)

* Look at missingness. [naniar](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) and [missingno](https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno) in Python. [VIM](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/4625_fa990d611f024ea69e7e2b10dd228fe7.html) and hmisc::naclus/naplot() in R.

* Imputation. Options include the Mean, Mode, KNN, Random, and Regression. mice, hmisc, alice in R.

* An R library for [categorical dissimilarity](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/StatMatch/versions/1.2.5/topics/gower.dist)

* [Easy Regex](https://github.com/VerbalExpressions/PythonVerbalExpressions)

* Check for blank spaces and replace with NA. In R: `df[df==""] = NA`.

* [Binned Stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.binned_statistic.html)

* Anomalies: xda::num/catSummary(.) | xray::anomalies(.)

### Visualize

* Quick Exploration Guide: S.O.C.S (Shape, Outlier, Center, Spread)

* Trendlines & Histograms

* Confidence intervals

* Compare the distributions of variables with overlayed density plots 

* Scatterplots: Pairwise and color/size the dots by other variables to try to identify any confounding relationships. GGally::ggpairs() or seaborn. 

* Dimensionality reduction (PCA, Kernel PCA, TSNE, Isomap) or hierarchical clustering for multivariate data to get a feel for high dimensional structure. 

### Model

* Stick to rergression models for prescriptive analysis. Validate assumptions and tune appropriately. If using Python leverage statsmodels.

* Pre-processing: vtreat in R.

* Use binning + chisquare / mutual information to see correlation between feature and target.

* Pipelines & Feature Unions: sklearn in Python, recipes in R.

* Feature Selection: Variance Threshold, Univariate Feature Selection (skl_fs.chi2 | f_regression | f_classification in sklearn), Multivariate Feature Selection (SelectKBest, SelectPercentile, feature_selection.RFECV in sklearn). See also the [Rebate](https://github.com/EpistasisLab/scikit-rebate) and [Boruta](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/boruta_py) packages in Python.
    
* Feature Engineering: Standardization, dimensionality reduction, dummying. sklearn.preprocessing.binarize, pandas.factorize, and featuretools for automation in Python. 

* Model Selection: yellowbrick, [Sklearn Evaluation](https://edublancas.github.io/sklearn-evaluation/), and [skl-plot](https://github.com/reiinakano/scikit-plot) in Python.

* Model Explanability: eli5 or [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) in Python but concentrate on the latter. SHAP also exists in R's xgboost library.

* Tuning: Do directed tuning instead of grid or random search. hyperopt-sklearn, sklearn-deap, and 

* Deal with potential class imbalance: 

   * Gradient boosting
   * http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/stable/

* Create ensembles: mlxtend in Python
    
* Choose Statistical Test

    * [1](http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/mult_pkg/whatstat/)
    * [2](http://www.qnamarkup.org/i/?source=http://colarusso.github.io/QnAMarkup/examples/source/WhatStats.txt)
    * infer library
    
* Check for correlations: https://github.com/drsimonj/corrr
    
* Ensembling: mlxtend in Python, and caretEnsemble in R.

* Look at learning curves: https://www.dataquest.io/blog/learning-curves-machine-learning/

* Use SHAP for model explanability

### Communicate

* Usually an R Markdown document.

### Deployment /  Maintenance

Write tests and helper functions.

A really useful feature is sharing environments so others can install all the packages used in your code, with the correct versions. You can save the packages to a YAML file with:

`conda env export > environment.yaml`

The first part conda env export writes out all the packages in the environment, including the Python version. Above you can see the name of the environment and all the dependencies (along with versions) are listed. The second part of the export command, > environment.yaml writes the exported text to a YAML file environment.yaml. This file can now be shared and others will be able to create the same environment you used for the project. To create an environment from an environment file use:

`conda env create -f environment.yaml`

This will create a new environment with the same name listed in environment.yaml.
