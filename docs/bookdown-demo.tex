\chapter{Workflow}\label{workflow}

\section{Preamble}\label{preamble}

A typical data science workflow can be framed as following these steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Business: start with a business question, define the goal and measure
  of success
\item
  Data: find, access and explore the data
\item
  Features: extract, assess and evaluate, select and sort
\item
  Models: find the right model for the problem at hand, compare,
  optimize, and fine tune
\item
  Communication: Interpret and communicate the results
\item
  Production: transform the code into production ready code, integrate
  into current ecosystem and deploy
\item
  Maintain: adapt the models and features to the evolution of the
  environment
\end{itemize}

More succinctly, as per Hadley Wickham:

import -\textgreater{} tidy -\textgreater{} understand {[} transform
\textless{}-\textgreater{} visualize \textless{}-\textgreater{} model
{]} -\textgreater{} communicate

My combination of the two:

preparation -\textgreater{} import -\textgreater{} tidy -\textgreater{}
understand {[} transform \textless{}-\textgreater{} visualize
\textless{}-\textgreater{} model {]} -\textgreater{} {[}communicate +
deploy + maintain{]}

Another note is that one way to structure projects is to write user
stories a la software engineering.

What lies below is a succinct version of a workflow. Theoretical
specifics can be found in other sections of this collection of
cribsheets, and libraries or packages to use not included in the Stack
can be found on this
\href{https://gfleetwood.github.io/noted-resources/data_science.html}{page}.

\subsection{Deployment / Maintenance}\label{deployment-maintenance}

\href{https://blog.osteele.com/2008/05/my-git-workflow/}{Git Workflow}

Write Tests.

Write helper functions, do testing:

\href{http://engineering.pivotal.io/post/test-driven-development-for-data-science/}{1}

\href{http://stochasticsolutions.com/}{3} \textbar{}
\href{https://github.com/ericmjl/data-testing-tutorial}{4})

And validation:

\href{https://github.com/shawnbrown/datatest}{3}

A really useful feature is sharing environments so others can install
all the packages used in your code, with the correct versions. You can
save the packages to a YAML file with:
\texttt{conda\ env\ export\ \textgreater{}\ environment.yaml}

The first part conda env export writes out all the packages in the
environment, including the Python version. Above you can see the name of
the environment and all the dependencies (along with versions) are
listed. The second part of the export command, \textgreater{}
environment.yaml writes the exported text to a YAML file
environment.yaml. This file can now be shared and others will be able to
create the same environment you used for the project. To create an
environment from an environment file use:
\texttt{conda\ env\ create\ -f\ environment.yaml}

This will create a new environment with the same name listed in
environment.yaml.

\chapter{Import, Tidy, Transform \&
Visualize}\label{import-tidy-transform-visualize}

\section{Import}\label{import-1}

\subsection{General}\label{general}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A schema is a blueprint for storing data. For a table every row has
  same number of columns, and each column is of the same type.
\item
  Make codebooks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{SQL}\label{sql}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Maintain a query library
\item
  Common Table Expressions
\item
  cross apply = inner join \textbar{} outer apply = full join
\item
  SQL UNION stacks one dataset on top of the other. It only appends
  distinct values. More specifically, when you use UNION, the dataset is
  appended, and any rows in the appended table that are exactly
  identical to rows in the first table are dropped. If you'd like to
  append all the values from the second table, use UNION ALL.
\item
  COUNT(DISTINCT month): returns count of non-null values like table in
  R
\item
  The CASE statement is followed by at least one pair of WHEN and THEN
  statements: CASE WHEN year = `SR' THEN `yes' ELSE NULL END. You can
  also define a number of outcomes in a CASE statement by including as
  many WHEN/THEN statements as you'd like
\item
  If you include two (or more) columns in a SELECT DISTINCT clause, your
  results will contain all of the unique pairs of those two columns
\end{itemize}

\section{Tidy}\label{tidy-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In tidy data: Each variable forms a column. Each observation forms a
  row. Each type of observational unit forms a table. There are three
  interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy.
\item
  Each variable must have its own column.
\item
  Each observation must have its own row.
\item
  Each value must have its own cell.
\end{itemize}

\section{Transform}\label{transform-1}

\subsection{General}\label{general-1}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  There is no one rule about when a number is not accurate enough to
  use, but as a rule of thumb, you should be cautious about using any
  number with a MOE (Margin-of-error) over 10\%.
\end{itemize}

A good formula is: if your sample is picked uniformly at random and is
of size at least:

\(\frac{-log(\frac{d}{2})}{2e^2}\)

then with probability at least 1-d your sample measured proportion q is
no further away than e from the unknown true population proportion p
(what you are trying to estimate). Need to estimate with 99\% certainty
the unknown true population rate to +- 10\% precision? That is d=0.01,
e=0.1 and a sample of size 265 should be enough. A stricter precision of
+-0.05 causes the estimated sample size to increase to 1060, but
increasing the certainty requirement to 99.5\% only increases the
estimated sample size to 300.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Use spatial sign to transform data with outliers.
\item
  Too many levels for a category:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    limit number of categories through feature selection
  \item
    \url{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/95212/improve-classification-with-many-categorical-variables}
    * bucket groups by number of samples
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Long story short, if these outliers are really such (i.e.~they appear
  with a very low frequency and very likely are bad/random/corrupted
  measurements) and they do not correspond to potential events/failures
  that your model should be aware of, you can safely remove them. In all
  other cases you should evaluate case by case what those outliers
  represent.
\item
  Otherwise, assuming levels of the categorical variable are ordered,
  the polyserial correlation (here it is in R), which is a variant of
  the better known polychoric correlation. Note the latter is defined
  based on the correlation between the numerical variable and a
  continuous latent trait underlying the categorical variable.
\item
  You should use a logarithmic scale when percent change, or change in
  orders of magnitude, is more important than changes in absolute units.
  You should also use a log scale to better visualize data that is
  heavily skewed. Taking the logarithm only works if the data is
  non-negative. There are other transforms, such as arcsinh or signed
  log, that you can use to decrease data range if you have zero or
  negative values.
\item
  Normalizing by mean and standard deviation is most meaningful when the
  data distribution is roughly symmetric.
\item
  Monetary amounts are often log- distributed---the log of the data is
  normally distributed. This leads us to the idea that taking the log of
  the data can restore symmetry to it.
\item
  Dixon and Chi-squared tests for outlier detection plus LOF Algorithm.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Missingness \& Imputation}\label{missingness-imputation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  There are three types of missingness: 1) Completely at Random, 2) At
  Random, 3) Not at random
\item
  Types of imputation
\item
  Mean: Simple but can distort distribution, underestimate standard
  deviation, and distort variable relationships by dragging correlation
  to zero.
\item
  Random: Can amplify outlier observation and induce bias.
\item
  Regression: Use observed variables and relationships between these
  variables. Must make assumptions and can badly extrapolate. \&
  multiple stochastic regression imputation
\item
  The pros of imputation: 1) Helps retain a larger sample size of your
  data, 2) Does not sacrifice all the available information in an
  observation because of sparse missingness, 3) Can potentially avoid
  unwanted bias.
\item
  The cons of imputation: 1) The standard errors of any estimates made
  during analyses following imputation can tend to be too small, 2) The
  methods are under the assumption that all measurements are actually
  ``known,'' when in fact some were imputed, 3) Can potentially induce
  unwanted bias.
\item
  logging converts multiplicative relationships to additive
  relationships, and by the same token it converts exponential (compound
  growth) trends to linear trends. By taking logarithms of variables
  which are multiplicatively related and/or growing exponentially over
  time, we can often explain their behavior with linear models.

\item
  sklearn log\_loss \textbar{} brier score\textbar{} cross entropy

\item
  hamming distance for categorical data. Available in sklearn DBSCAN.
\item
  precision: how good were you at something being true when you said it
  was true. recall: how many of the true values did you catch. f1:
  harmonic mean of the two
\item
  Brier score: Don't use for ordinal predictions. 0.25 if say .5 and .33
  if randomly assign probs.
\item
  R uses class encoded as 1 in classification to make predictions. Use
  levels() function on factor to determine what 1 is.
\item
  20 observations per feature is pretty good for making predictions.
\item
  y = b\_0 + b\_1x\_1 + b\_2x\_2 + b\_3x\_1x\_2. ( b\_1 + b\_2x\_2 ) is
  the increase in y with a unit increase in x\_1.

  Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Singular Value Decomposition, Makov
  Chains, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, Association Rules, Gradient
  Boosted Decision Trees, Random Forests, Affinity Propagation, K-Means,
  Matrix Factorization, Alternating Least Squares.
\item
  For example, multilevel models themselves may be referred to as
  hierarchical linear models, random effects models, multilevel models,
  random intercept models, random slope models, or pooling models.
\item
  Multi-Modal Classification: In the machine learning community, the
  term Multi-Modal is used to refer to multiple kinds of data. For
  example, consider a YouTube video. It can be thought to contain 3
  different modalities: 1) The video frames (visual modality), 2) The
  audio clip of what's being spoken (audio modality), 3) Some videos
  also come with the transcription of the words spoken in the form of
  subtitles (textual modality)
\item
  Less samples and more features increase the chance of overfitting.
\item
  You can choose either of the following inference strategies: offline
  inference, meaning that you make all possible predictions in a batch,
  using a MapReduce or something similar. You then write the predictions
  to an SSTable or Bigtable, and then feed these to a cache/lookup
  table. online inference, meaning that you predict on demand, using a
  server.
\item
  A static model is trained offline. That is, we train the model exactly
  once and then use that trained model for a while. A dynamic model is
  trained online. That is, data is continually entering the system and
  we're incorporating that data into the model through continuous
  updates.
\item
  How would multiplying all of the predictions from a given model by 2.0
  (for example, if the model predicts 0.4, we multiply by 2.0 to get a
  prediction of 0.8) change the model's performance as measured by AUC?
  No change. AUC only cares about relative prediction scores. Yes, AUC
  is based on the relative predictions, so any transformation of the
  predictions that preserves the relative ranking has no effect on AUC.
  This is clearly not the case for other metrics such as squared error,
  log loss, or prediction bias (discussed later).
\item
  AUC is desirable for the following two reasons: AUC is
  scale-invariant. It measures how well predictions are ranked, rather
  than their absolute values. UC is classification-threshold-invariant.
  It measures the quality of the model's predictions irrespective of
  what classification threshold is chosen. However, both these reasons
  come with caveats, which may limit the usefulness of AUC in certain
  use cases: Scale invariance is not always desirable. For example,
  sometimes we really do need well calibrated probability outputs, and
  AUC won't tell us about that. Classification-threshold invariance is
  not always desirable. In cases where there are wide disparities in the
  cost of false negatives vs.~false positives, it may be critical to
  minimize one type of classification error. For example, when doing
  email spam detection, you likely want to prioritize minimizing false
  positives (even if that results in a significant increase of false
  negatives). AUC isn't a useful metric for this type of optimization.
\item
  Raising our classification threshold will cause the number of true
  positives to decrease or stay the same and will cause the number of
  false negatives to increase or stay the same. Thus, recall will either
  stay constant or decrease. In general, raising the classification
  threshold reduces false positives, thus raising precision.
\item
  A feature cross is a synthetic feature formed by multiplying
  (crossing) two or more features. Crossing combinations of features can
  provide predictive abilities beyond what those features can provide
  individually.
\item
  Bias: Error Introduced by approximating real-life problem by using a
  simple method
\item
  Imagine a linear model with two strongly correlated features; that is,
  these two features are nearly identical copies of one another but one
  feature contains a small amount of random noise. If we train this
  model with L2 regularization, what will happen to the weights for
  these two features? L2 regularization will force the features towards
  roughly equivalent weights that are approximately half of what they
  would have been had only one of the two features been in the model.
\item
  L2 regularization will encourage many of the non-informative weights
  to be nearly (but not exactly) 0.0.
\item
  F1 Score = TP/(TP + FP + FN). Essentially how good you are at
  identifying the positive class.
\item
  A variable that is completely useless by itself can provide a
  significant performance improvement when taken with others.
\item
  Variance: The amount the model output will change if the model was
  trained using a different data
\item
  Flexible Methods: higher variance, low bias, Example: KNN (k = 1). *
  Inflexible Methods: low variance, high bias, Example: Linear
  regression
\item
  Set Random state by hand in sklearn.
\item
  Generally need 3 rows of data per variable (to prevent model from
  seeing signal where there is only noise) {[}Nina Zumel{]}
\item
  Domain knowledge for feature selection and random forest feature
  importance (5-10) best variables. {[}Nina Zumel{]}
\item
  Because we have a couple thousand data points, even though salary can
  best be represented by a Poisson distribution, I'm going to use
  Gaussian distribution. (With bigger datasets, these two distribution
  start to become very similar).
\item
  We can also tell that our input, smart\_1\_normalized, doesn't have a
  very strong relationship to our output because the standard error
  (0.009) is more than 1/10 of our estimate (0.02).
\item
  The less complex an ML model, the more likely that a good empirical
  result is not just due to the peculiarities of the sample.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pre-processing}\label{pre-processing}

\section{Feature Engineering}\label{feature-engineering}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  encode missingness a a feature
\item
  Dealing with cyclical features: Hours of the day, days of the week,
  months in a year, and wind direction are all examples of features that
  are cyclical. Many new machine learning engineers don't think to
  convert these features into a representation that can preserve
  information such as hour 23 and hour 0 being close to each other and
  not far. Keeping with the hour example, the best way to handle this is
  to calculate the sin and cos component so that you represent your
  cyclical feature as (x,y) coordinates of a circle. In this
  representation hour, 23 and hour 0 are right next to each other
  numerically, just as they should be.

\section{Feature Selection}\label{feature-selection}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Variance Threshold: Use this to exclude features that don't meet a
  variance threshold.
\item
  Univariate Feature Selection: For classification can use chi-squared
  and F-Test while F-Test for regression. Functions: chi2,
  f\_regression, f\_classification from sklearn.feature\_selection.
\item
  SelectKBest/SelectPercentile: Keep the k highest scoring features and
  keep a user-specified highest scoring percentage of features. Can use
  the univariate feature selection in these functions.
\item
  sklearn.feature\_selection.RFE(CV)
\item
  To work around magic values, convert the feature into two features:
  One feature holds only quality ratings, never magic values. One
  feature holds a boolean value indicating whether or not a
  quality\_rating was supplied. Give this boolean feature a name like
  is\_quality\_rating\_defined.
\item
  Handling extreme outliers: Given data with a very long tail, log
  scaling does a slightly better job, but there's still a significant
  tail of outlier values. Let's pick yet another approach. What if we
  simply ``cap'' or ``clip'' the maximum value at an arbitrary value,
  say 4.0? Clipping the feature value at 4.0 doesn't mean that we ignore
  all values greater than 4.0. Rather, it means that all values that
  were greater than 4.0 now become 4.0. This explains the funny hill at
  4.0. Despite that hill, the scaled feature set is now more useful than
  the original data. Binning.
\item
  Know your data. Follow these rules: 1) Keep in mind what you think
  your data should look like. 2) Verify that the data meets these
  expectations (or that you can explain why it doesn't). 3) Double-check
  that the training data agrees with other sources (for example,
  dashboards).
\end{itemize}

\section{Other}\label{other}

\subsection{Unbalanced Classes}\label{unbalanced-classes}

Research on imbalanced classes often considers imbalanced to mean a
minority class of 10\% to 20\%.

That said, here is a rough outline of useful approaches. These are
listed approximately in order of effort:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Do nothing. Sometimes you get lucky and nothing needs to be done. You
  can train on the so-called natural (or stratified) distribution and
  sometimes it works without need for modification.
\item
  Balance the training set in some way: Oversample the minority class.
  Undersample the majority class. Synthesize new minority classes.
\end{itemize}

*Throw away minority examples and switch to an anomaly detection
framework.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  At the algorithm level, or after it: Adjust the class weight
  (misclassification costs). Adjust the decision threshold. Modify an
  existing algorithm to be more sensitive to rare classes.
\item
  Construct an entirely new algorithm to perform well on imbalanced
  data.
\item
  Use AUC, F1 Score, Cohen's Kappa, ROC curve, a precision-recall curve,
  a lift curve, or a profit (gain) curve for evaluation.
\item
  Use probability estimates and not the default .5 threshold.
\item
  Undersampling, oversampling, increase weight of minority class
\item
  Decision trees often perform well on imbalanced datasets because their
  hierarchical structure allows them to learn signals from both classes.
\item
  Sklearn Eg: wclf = svm.SVC(kernel=`linear', class\_weight=\{1: 10\})
  \& svm.SVC(kernel=`linear', class\_weight=`balanced')
\end{itemize}

\section{Model Selection}\label{model-selection}

\subsection{General}\label{general-3}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Make sure that your test set meets the following two conditions: 1) Is
  large enough to yield statistically meaningful results, 2) Is
  representative of the data set as a whole. In other words, don't pick
  a test set with different characteristics than the training set.
\item
  Linear SVM often outperforms logistic regression and is explainable as
  well.
\item
  However, the problem with cross-validation is that it is rarely
  applicable to real world problems, for all the reasons described in
  the above sections. Cross-validation only works in the same cases
  where you can randomly shuffle your data to choose a validation set.
\item
  If the performance of a classification model on the test set
  (out-of-sample) error is poor, you can't just re-calibrate your model
  parameters to achieve a better model. This is cheating.
\item
  When the classes are well-separated, the parameter estimates for the
  logistic regression model are surprisingly unstable. Linear
  discriminant analysis does not suffer from this problem. If n is small
  and the distribution of the predictors X is approximately normal in
  each of the classes, the linear discriminant model is again more
  stable than the logistic regression model.
\item
  Roughly speaking, LDA tends to be a better bet than QDA if there are
  relatively few training observations and so reducing variance is
  crucial. In contrast, QDA is recommended if the training set is very
  large, so that the variance of the classifier is not a major concern,
  or if the assumption of a common covariance matrix for the K classes
  is clearly untenable.
\item
  Two features interact if the effect on the prediction of one feature
  depends on the value of the other feature
\item
  Warning PolynomialFeatures(degree=d) transforms an array containing n
  features into an array containing features, where n! is the factorial
  of n, equal to 1 × 2 × 3 × ⋯ × n. Beware of the combinatorial
  explosion of the number of features!
\item
  It appears that each feature has modestly improved our model. There
  are certainly more features that we could add to our model. For
  example, we could add the day of the week and the hour of the posting,
  we could determine if the article is a listicle by running a regex on
  the headline, or we could examine the sentiment of each article. This
  only begins to touch on the features that could be important to model
  virality. We would certainly need to go much further to continue
  reducing the error in our model.
\item
  Suppose Fixitol reduces symptoms by 20\% over a placebo, but the trial
  you're using to test it is too small to have adequate statistical
  power to detect this difference reliably. We know that small trials
  tend to have varying results; it's easy to get 10 lucky patients who
  have shorter colds than usual but much harder to get 10,000 who all
  do.
\item
  As I mentioned earlier, one drawback of the Bonferroni correction is
  that it greatly decreases the statistical power of your experiments,
  making it more likely that you'll miss true effects. More
  sophisticated procedures than Bonferroni correction exist, ones with
  less of an impact on statistical power, but even these are not magic
  bullets. Worse, they don't spare you from the base rate fallacy. You
  can still be misled by your p threshold and falsely claim there's
  ``only a 5\% chance I'm wrong.'' Procedures like the Bonferroni
  correction only help you eliminate some false positives.
\item
  In step 1, we find where missing values are located. The md.pattern()
  function from the mice package is a really useful function. It gives
  you a clear view of where missing values are located, helping you in
  decisions regarding exclusions or substitution. You can refer to the
  next recipe for missing value substitution.
\item
  Another possible indication of collinearity in the inputs is seeing
  coefficients with an unexpected sign: for example, seeing that income
  is negatively correlated with years in the workforce.
\item
  The overall model can still predict income quite well, even when the
  inputs are correlated; it just can't determine which variable deserves
  the credit for the prediction. Using regularization (especially ridge
  regression as found in lm.ridge() in the package MASS) is helpful in
  collinear situations (we prefer it to ``x-alone'' variable
  preprocessing, such as principal components analysis). If you want to
  use the coefficient values as advice as well as to make good
  predictions.
\item
  The degrees of freedom is thought of as the number of training data
  rows you have after correcting for the number of coefficients you
  tried to solve for. You want the degrees of freedom to be large
  compared to the number of coefficients fit to avoid overfitting.
\item
  The probable reason for nonconvergence is separation or
  quasi-separation: one of the model variables or some combination of
  the model variables predicts the outcome perfectly for at least a
  subset of the training data. You'd think this would be a good thing,
  but ironically logistic regression fails when the variables are too
  powerful.
\item
  For categorical variables (male/female, or small/medium/large), you
  can define the distance as 0 if two points are in the same category,
  and 1 otherwise. If all the variables are categorical, then you can
  use Hamming distance, which counts the number of mismatches.
\item
  Your next step is to select a performance measure. A typical
  performance measure for regression problems is the Root Mean Square
  Error (RMSE). It measures the standard deviation of the errors the
  system makes in its predictions.
\item
  You should save every model you experiment with, so you can come back
  easily to any model you want. Make sure you save both the
  hyperparameters and the trained parameters, as well as the
  cross-validation scores and perhaps the actual predictions as well.
  This will allow you to easily compare scores across model types, and
  compare the types of errors they make. You can easily save
  Scikit-Learn models by using Python's pickle module, or using
  sklearn.externals.joblib, which is more efficient at serializing large
  NumPy arrays.
\item
  If all classifiers are able to estimate class probabilities (i.e.,
  they have a predict\_proba() method), then you can tell Scikit-Learn
  to predict the class with the highest class probability, averaged over
  all the individual classifiers. This is called soft voting. It often
  achieves higher performance than hard voting because it gives more
  weight to highly confident votes. All you need to do is replace
  voting=``hard'' with voting=``soft'' and ensure that all classifiers
  can estimate class probabilities.
\item
  The standard value for k in k-fold cross-validation is 10, which is
  typically a reasonable choice for most applications. However, if we
  are working with relatively small training sets, it can be useful to
  increase the number of folds. If we increase the value of k, more
  training data will be used in each iteration, which results in a lower
  bias towards estimating the generalization performance by averaging
  the individual model estimates. However, large values of k will also
  increase the runtime of the cross-validation algorithm and yield
  estimates with higher variance since the training folds will be more
  similar to each other. On the other hand, if we are working with large
  datasets, we can choose a smaller value for k.
\item
  Distance Metrics: Hamming distance for categorical variables, Cosine
  distance for text data, Gower distance for categorical data
\item
  AIC x BIC: Explanatory power x Parsimonious
\item
  Bias is how far offon the average the model is from the truth.
  Variance is how much the estimate varies about its average. With low
  model complexity bias is high because predictions are more likely to
  stray from the truth, and variance is low because there are only few
  parameters being fit. With high model complexity bias is low because
  the model can adapt to more subtleties in the data, and variance is
  high because we have more parameters to estimate from the same amount
  of data.
\item
  The mean of highly correlated quantities has higher variance than the
  mean of uncorrelated quantities. The smaller the number of folds, the
  more biased the error estimates (they will be biased to be
  conservative indicating higher error than there is in reality) but the
  less variable they will be. On the extreme end you can have one fold
  for each data point which is known as Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation.
  In this case, your error estimate is essentially unbiased but it could
  potentially have high variance.
\item
  LDA vs Logistic Regression: When the classes are well-separated
  parameters of logistic regression are unstable and LDA doesn't have
  this problem. If the distribution of X is approximately normal then
  LDA is more stable again. LDA doesn't need to fit multiple models for
  multiclass classification.
\item
  SVM vs Logistic Regression: SVM is likely to overfit the data and can
  dominated LR on the training set. Kernel method makes SVM more
  flexible.
\item
  Decision Tree vs Linear Model: Tree has non-linear boundary, selects
  important features, easier to intepret but unstable especially for
  small data.
\item
  Naive Bayes vs LDA: Both use Bayes theorem, both assume gaussian
  distribution, but LDA takes care of the correlations. LDA might
  out-perform Naive Bayes when the features are highly correlated.
\item
  KNN vs Other Classification Methods: KNN is completely non-parametic,
  doesn't tell which features are important. Dominates LDA and Logistic
  Regression when the decision boundary is highly non-linear.
\item
  When building, testing, and validating a suite of models, the optimal
  model (i.e., the optimal point in the ROC curve) is the spot where the
  overall accuracy of the model is essentially unchanged as we make
  small adjustments in the choice of model. That is to say, the change
  (from one model to the next) in the model's precision (specificity) is
  exactly offset by the change in the model's recall (sensitivity).
  Consequently, allowing for some imperfection, where the false positive
  rate and the false negative rate are in proper balance (so that
  neither one has too great of an impact on the overall accuracy and
  effectiveness of the model), is good fruit from your big data labors.
  The metric I used to guide my cross-validation is the F-score. This is
  a good metric when we have a lot more samples from one category than
  from the other categories.
\item
  The cost of the holdout method comes in the amount of data that is
  removed from the model training process. For instance, in the
  illustrative example here, we removed 30\% of our data. This means
  that our model is trained on a smaller data set and its error is
  likely to be higher than if we trained it on the full data set. The
  standard procedure in this case is to report your error using the
  holdout set, and then train a final model using all your data.
\item
  A metric that minimizes false positives, by rarely flagging players
  and teams that fail to achieve the desired outcome, is specific. A
  metric that minimizes false negatives, by rarely failing to flag
  players and teams that achieve the desired outcome, is sensitive.
\item
  Sometimes it may be more useful to report the coefficient of
  determination (), which can be understood as a standardized version of
  the MSE, for better interpretability of the model performance. In
  other words, is the fraction of response variance that is captured by
  the model. The value is defined as follows:Here, SSE is the sum of
  squared errors and SST is the total sum of squares , or in other
  words, it is simply the variance of the response.
\item
  Most people start working with data from exactly the wrong end. They
  begin with a data set, then apply their favorite tools and techniques
  to it. The result is narrow questions and shallow arguments. Starting
  with data, without first doing a lot of thinking, without having any
  structure, is a short road to simple questions and unsurprising
  results. We don't want unsurprising - we want knowledge.
\item
  Remember that the positive class in scikit-learn is the class that is
  labeled as class 1. If we want to specify a different positive label,
  we can construct our own scorer via the make\_scorer function, which
  we can then directly provide as an argument to the scoring parameter
  in GridSearchCV
\item
  While the weighted macro-average is the default for multiclass
  problems in scikit-learn, we can specify the averaging method via the
  average parameter inside the different scoring functions that we
  import from the sklean.metrics module, for example, the
  precision\_score or make\_scorer functions
\item
  Transforming words into feature vectorsTo construct a bag-of-words
  model based on the word counts in the respective documents, we can use
  the CountVectorizer class implemented in scikit-learn. As we will see
  in the following code section, the CountVectorizer class takes an
  array of text data, which can be documents or just sentences, and
  constructs the bag-of-words model for us:
\item
  Naive Bayes is a linear classifier, while KNN is not. The curse of
  dimensionality and large feature sets are a problem for KNN, while
  Naive Bayes performs well. KNN requires no training (just load in the
  dataset), whereas Naive Bayes does.
\item
  The McNemar test, introduced by Quinn McNemar in 1947 (McNemar 1947),
  is a non-parametric statistical test for paired comparisons that can
  be applied to compare the performance of two machine learning
  classifiers. Cochran's Q Test or F Test for \textgreater{}2.

\subsection{Linear Regression}\label{linear-regression}

Discuss Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic here.

The standard least squares coefficient estimates are scale equivariant:
if we multiply a predictor variable by a constant, the corresponding
least squares coefficient estimate will be scaled down by the same
constant. Used when you're predicting a continuous value. In regression,
it is often recommended to center the variables so that the predictors
have mean 0. This makes it so the intercept term is interpreted as the
expected value of Y\_i when the predictor values are set to their means.
Otherwise, the intercept is interpreted as the expected value of Y\_i
when the predictors are set to 0, which may not be a realistic or
interpretable situation. When p \textgreater{} n, we can no longer
calculate a unique least square coefficient estimate, the variances
become infinite, so OLS cannot be used at all.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In presence of few variables with medium / large sized effect, use
  lasso regression. In presence of many variables with small / medium
  sized effect, use ridge regression.
\item
  The fitted regression line using a sample of data gives imperfect
  predictions for future observations due to sampling variability and
  randomness in Y that is not related to X.
\item
  Linear Correlation =\textgreater{} Causation if covariates respect:
  linearity normality indep homoscedasticity + all confounders in model
\item
  In summary, ``pooling'' your data and fitting one combined regression
  function allows you to easily and efficiently answer research
  questions concerning the binary predictor variable.
\item
  If two independent variables are measured in exactly the same units,
  we can asses their relative importance in their effect on y quite
  simply: the larger the coefficient, the stronger the effect.
\item
  Okay, so many of the features are strongly correlated. We can make use
  of this in our model by including polynomial features
  (e.g.~PolynomialFeatures(degree=2) from scikit-learn). Adding these
  brings our validation loss down to 0.69256 (-0.05\% from baseline).
\item
  We prefer natural logs (that is, logarithms base e) because, as
  described above, coefficients on the natural-log scale are directly
  interpretable as approximate proportional differences: with a
  coefficient of 0.06, a difference of 1 in x corresponds to an
  approximate 6\% difference in y, and so forth.
\end{itemize}

The regression assumption that is generally least important is that the
errors are normally distributed. In fact, for the purpose of estimating
the regression line (as compared to predicting individual data points),
the assumption of normality is barely important at all. Thus, in
contrast to many regression textbooks, we do not recommend diagnostics
of the normality of regression residuals. {[}Gelman{]}

Linear regression errors are not autocorrelated. The Durbin-Watson
statistic detects this; if it is close to 2, there is no
autocorrelation.

A linear regression model is only as good as the validity of its
assumptions, which can be summarized as: \(y = b_0+b_1x + \epsilon\),
\(\epsilon\) is i.i.d from N(0, \(\sigma\)). More verbosely:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Linearity: This is a linear relationship between the predictor and the
  response variables. If this relationship is not clearly present,
  transformations (log, polynomial, exponent and so on) of the X or Y
  may solve the problem. Check with a scatterplot.
\item
  Normality: The error terms are drawn from an identical Gaussian
  distribution, i.e a normal distribution of the dependent variable for
  each value of the independent variable. Inspect the quantile-quantile
  plot of the residuals. Also Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality.
\item
  Non-correlation or independence of errors: A common problem in the
  time series and panel data where en = betan-1; if the errors are
  correlated, you run the risk of creating a poorly specified model. The
  residual value for an arbitrary observation is not predictable from
  knowledge of another observation's residual value; they are
  uncorrelated. Inspect the residual plot after fitting the regression.
  Ideally, there would be no clear pattern in the fluctuation of the
  error terms.
\item
  Homoscedasticity (constant variance): Normally the distributed and
  constant variance of errors, which means that the variance of the
  errors is constant across the different values of inputs. Violations
  of this assumption can create biased coefficient estimates, leading to
  statistical tests for significance that can be either too high or too
  low. This, in turn, leads to the wrong conclusion. This violation is
  referred to as heteroscedasticity. The error terms have the same
  variance. Check the residual plot which is a scatterplot of the
  residuals vs the fitted values.
\item
  No multi-colinearity: No linear relationship between two predictor
  variables, which is to say that there should be no correlation between
  the features. This, again, can lead to biased estimates. If not
  coefficient estimates could be unstable, introduce redundancies within
  predictors, and make it more difficult to make inferences. Could
  inflate standard errors, decrease power and reliability of regression
  coefficients, and create need for a larger sample size. Check the
  variance inflation factors. Tells the factor by which the estimated
  variance of a variable is larger in comparison ti it it were
  completely uncorrelated with other variables in the model. If the VIF
  is more than five then the variable is a candidate to remove from the
  model. Its information is contained in the other variables. Variance
  Inflation Factor: MEasures how the model facotrs influence hte
  uncertainity of coefficient estimates. \textgreater{}=5 is bad.
\item
  Minimal outliers: Outliers can severely skew the estimation and,
  ideally, must be removed prior to fitting a model using linear
  regression; this again can lead to a biased estimate.
\end{itemize}

Outliers are observations that have high residual values. Leverage
points are observations that have unusually small or large independent
variable values. Cook's distance helps to measure the effect of deleting
an observation from the \#dataset and rerunning the regression.
Observations that have large residual values and also high leverage tend
to pose threats to the accuracy of the regression line and thus need to
be further investigated. Look at influence plot. Confidence and
prediction intervals. For avplot distinct patterns are indications of
good contributions. Influence plot to look at hat values (lower is
better). Use F-test to compare models. F-test \& partial f-testr for
simple and multiple linear regression.

Fixing assumptions:

Transformations: Can remedy assumption violations and strengthen linear
relationships between variables, but can lead to overfitting and less
interpretability. square root correction: Take square root of x
variable(s). log transformation: Take log of y. General rule of thumb:
powers \textgreater{} 1 for skewed left data, powers \textless{} 1 for
data skewed right.

Box-Cox: Iterates along values of lambda by maximum likelihood so as to
maximize the fit of the transformed variable to a normal distribution.
Does not guarantee normality since it minimizes standard deviation. Can
only be used on positive values. Use on negative values by shifting by a
constant value. Use Box-Cox transformations when predictions are skewed.

\subsection{Selection}\label{selection}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Forward and Backward Stepwise Selection.
\item
  For simple linear regression, the principal hypothesis test is as
  follows: H\_0 : ? 1 = 0, H\_A: ? 1 ≠ 0. If H\_0 is true then the
  population mean of Y would be ? 0 no matter what the value of X. (X
  has no effect on Y.)
\item
  F-Test: H\_0 says that all/some coefficients are zero versus H\_a
  which says that there is at least one non-zero coefficient. If h0 fail
  to reject than F value close to 1, else F value greater than 1.
\item
  A.I.C and B.I.C: Smaller values are better. Can be used to compare
  multiple models at the same time. They reward goodness of fit and
  penalizes complexity. Favor A.I.C for prediction and B.I.C for
  descriptive power (penalty term more stringest and favors a
  parsimonious model)
\item
  R-squared increases whenever a predictor is added, and it doesn't take
  model complexity into consideration which makes it prone to
  overfitting. Use adjusted R-squared instead. Additional predictors
  only make this increase is they are statistically significant. It's
  easy to show that given no other data for a set of numbers, the
  predictor that minimises the MAE is the median, while the predictor
  that minimises the MSE is the mean.
\item
  Compare RSME to sd of data for sense of how good it is. (If RSME
  \textless{} sd then good.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pros/Cons}\label{proscons}

\textbf{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Very fast (runs in constant time)
\item
  Easy to understand the model
\item
  Less prone to overfitting
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cons}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Unable to model complex relationships
\item
  Unable to capture nonlinear relationships without first transforming
  the inputs

  RSS is The sum of the squared error terms for each observation in our
  dataset. RSE is The standard deviation of the residuals about the
  regression surface and is an estimate of sigma. TSS is a measure of
  the total squared deviation of our response variable from its mean
  value. R\^{}2 = 1 -- RSS/TSS.

\section{Ridge/Lasso}\label{ridgelasso}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro}

Minimizes RSS but also has shrinkage penalty (L2 penalty). A small
lambda penalizes the RSS more than the shrinkage penalty. A large lambda
penalizes the shrinkage penalty more than the RSS. By shrinking the
coefficient estimates towards 0 by increasing lambda, the bias increases
slightly but remains relatively small, the variance reduces
substantially, and the mean squared error of the predictions drops. Not
scale invariant due to the shrinkage penalty. To avoid the issue of
overvaluing or undervaluing certain predictor variables simply based on
their magnitudes, we must standardize the variables prior to performing
ridge regression. The main disadvantage of ridge regression is that,
while parameter estimates are shrunken, they only asymptotically
approach 0 as we increase the value of lambda.

Standardize for ridge/lasso alpha makes them not scale invariant

Minimizes RSS but also has L1 penalty (norm). This necessarily
forcessome coefficient estimates to be exactly 0 (when lambda is
sufficiently large). It has the added advantage of essentially
performing variable selection, yielding models that are both accurate
and parsimonious. Restricting ourselves to simpler models by including a
Lasso penalty will generally decrease the variance of the fits at the
cost of higher bias.

Note: In both ridge and lasso regression, is important to select an
appropriate value of lambda by means of cross-validation.

\section{Logistic Regression}\label{logistic-regression}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-1}

logistic is the same as probit

wilkinson rogers logistic regression

weighted logistic regression

The right-hand predictor side of the equation must be linear with the
left-hand outcome side of the equation. You must test for linearity in
the logit (in logistic regression the logit is the outcome side). This
is commonly done with the Box-Tidwell Transformation (Test): Add to the
logistic model interaction terms which are the crossproduct of each
independent times its natural logarithm {[}(X)ln(X){]}. If these terms
are significant, then there is nonlinearity in the logit. This method is
not sensitive to small nonlinearities.

Logistic regression assumes that logit(y) is linear in the values of x.
Like linear regression, logistic regression will find the best
coefficients to predict y, including finding advantageous combinations
and cancellations when the inputs are correlated. In other words, you
can think of logistic regression as a linear regression that finds the
log-odds of the probability that you're interested in. Logistic
Regression can also be used with kernel methods.

Logistic: When you're predicting which category your observation is in.
(Is this is a cat or a dog?)

The link function is the logit function. Logit is the inverse of the
sigmoid and gives the log odds, i.e p/(1-p).

Easy to incorpotate prior knowledge, number fo features are small,
training is fast, precision not critical.

No closed form expression to maximize coefficients with maximum
likelihood estimation, so one uses gradient descent or stochastic
gradient descent. The second one is faster.

For logistic regression value of c penalizes features. Low c penalizes a
lot and vice versa. A large c decreases the effect of the regularization
term (the l2 penalization).

Makes a linear boundary between classes.

For multiclass classification it will build multiple models. Given 3
classes 0,1, and 2, there will be models 0 and not 0, 1 and not 1, and 2
and not 2.

Standardization isn't required for logistic regression. The main goal of
standardizing features is to help convergence of the technique used for
optimization. For example, if you use Newton-Raphson to maximize the
likelihood, standardizing the features makes the convergence faster.
Otherwise, you can run your logistic regression without any
standardization treatment on the features.

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The linear regression analysis requires all variables to be
  multivariate normal. This assumption can best be checked with a
  histogram or a Q-Q-Plot.
\item
  Requires the dependent variable to be binary and ordinal logistic
  regression requires the dependent variable to be ordinal.
\item
  The observations to be independent of each other. In other words, the
  observations should not come from repeated measurements or matched
  data.
\item
  There to be little or no multicollinearity among the independent
  variables.
\item
  Assumes linearity of independent variables and logit of the
  probabilities (logit(p) = log(p/(1-p))). Check
  \href{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/169348/how-should-i-check-the-assumption-of-linearity-to-the-logit-for-the-continuous-i}{in
  R}.
\item
  There is no influential values (extreme values or outliers) in the
  continuous predictors
\end{itemize}

Notice the points fall along a line in the middle of the graph, but
curve off in the extremities. Normal Q-Q plots that exhibit this
behavior usually mean your data have more extreme values than would be
expected if they truly came from a Normal distribution.

The Durbin-Watson test is used to test the null hypothesis that linear
regression residuals are uncorrelated, against the alternative that
autocorrelation exists

\section{Poisson Regression}\label{poisson-regression}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-2}

Poisson: When you're predicting a count value. (How many dogs will I see
in the park?)

Poisson Regression: The Poisson distribution is used to model variation
in count data (that is, data that can equal 0,1,2,\ldots{}).

Remember that you must specify family = poisson or family = quasipoisson
when using glm() to fit a count model.

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-1}

One of the assumptions of Poisson regression to predict counts is that
the event you are counting is Poisson distributed: the average count per
unit time is the same as the variance of the count. In practice, ``the
same'' means that the mean and the variance should be of a similar order
of magnitude.

When the variance is much larger than the mean, the Poisson assumption
doesn't apply, and one solution is to use quasipoisson regression, which
does not assume that variance=meanvariance=mean.

\section{Generalized Additive Models}\label{generalized-additive-models}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-3}

mgcv::gam: More complex than lm, more likely to overfit, best used on
larger data sets. use s(var) to denote non-linear relationship. Don't
use s() with categorical variable. Use type = terms for y values of
plots to get predictions type = response.

Also remember that gam() from the package mgcv has the calling interface

gam(formula, family, data) For standard regression, use family =
gaussian (the default).

For GAM models, the predict() method returns a matrix, so use
as.numeric() to convert the matrix to a vector.

\section{K-Means Clustering {[}US{]}}\label{k-means-clustering-us}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-4}

K-Means clustering method considers two assumptions regarding the
clusters -- first that the clusters are spherical and second that the
clusters are of similar size.

k-means assumes the variance of the distribution of each attribute
(variable) is spherical; all variables have the same variance;

the prior probability for all k clusters is the same, i.e., each cluster
has roughly equal number of observations;

Must choose k for clusters. Initialize cluster centes randomly, assign
each point to its closest cluster by a distance metric. Recalculate
centroids. Halt when cluster assignments no longer change. Clusters will
be distinct and non-overlapping.

Goal to minimize within-cluster variation. The within-cluster variation
for the kth cluster is the sum of all of the pairwise squared Euclidean
distances between the observations in the kth cluster divided by the
total number of observations in the kth cluster. Limitation is that it
depends on initialization of centroids. Guaranteed convergence but only
to a local minima. Run the algorithm several times and pick the solution
that yields the smallest within-cluster variance. Increasing k will
decrease variance and increase bias and vice versa. K-means: Jaccard
coefficient.

Note: Not enough to use within-cluster variance as this decreases as one
increases k. Use elbow method or scree plot to choose optimal k where
the variance no longer decreases dramatically. To choose how many groups
to use, I ran a k-means analysis for each possible number of groups from
5 to 35 and found that 20 was right about the spot that the amount of
variance stopped decreasing consistently. This is called the elbow test
and while the results weren't totally definitive, they fit in well with
the general rule of thumb for determining \# of groups which is the
square root of the \# of observations/2.

One way to assess whether a cluster represents true structure is to see
if the cluster holds up under plausible variations in the dataset. The
fpc package has a function called clusterboot() that uses bootstrap
resampling to evaluate how stable a given cluster is.{[}3{]}
clusterboot() is an integrated function that both performs the
clustering and evaluates the final produced clusters. It has interfaces
to a number of R clustering algorithms, including both hclust and
kmeans.

In K-means, we assume that each cluster fits a Gaussian distribution
(normal distribution)

We can set K to optimally cluster the data by starting with a small
number of clusters, and then iteratively splitting them until all
clusters fit a normal distribution.

Davies--Bouldin index: This is an internal evaluation scheme, where the
validation of how well the clustering has been done is made using
quantities and features inherent to the dataset. This has a drawback
that a good value reported by this method does not imply the best
information retrieval.

\textbf{Pros}

Uses simple principle which can be explained in non-statistical terms.
It is efficient.

\textbf{Cons}

Less sophisticated, random choices of centers, and requires guess for
centers.

\section{Hierarchical Clustering}\label{hierarchical-clustering}

Generates dendrograms. The lower down a fusion occurs the more similar
the group of observations and vice versa. Begin with n observations and
a distance measure of all pairwise dissimialirities. Evaluate pairwise
intercluster dissimiliarities among the clusters and fuse pair of
clusters that are least dissimilar. Repeat process for remaining
clusters. Continue for i=n to i=2. Need to pick a dissimilarity measure
and a linkage method. Complete linkage: maximal inter-cluster
dissimilarity, single linkage: minimal inter-cluster dissimilarity,
avergae linkage: mean inter-cluster dissimilarity. Complete is sensitive
to outliers but tends to produce compact clusters. Distance between
groups: complete, average, and ward. Single not as sensitive to outliers
but susceptible to chaining effect where clusters can often not
represent intuitive groups. Average strikes a balance between the two.
Usually standardize data before clustering. Sklearn.metrics has pairwise
distances.

K-Means vs Hierarchical Clustering: K-means clustering needs the number
of clusters to be speciﬁed. Hierarchical clustering doesn't need the
number of clusters to be speciﬁed. K-means clustering is usually more
effcient run-time wise.

\section{PCA}\label{pca}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-5}

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-4}

\subsection{Characteristics}\label{characteristics-1}

\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-4}

\subsection{Pros/Cons}\label{proscons-5}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Center and scale data. The eigenvectors yield orthogonal directions of
  greatest variability(principal components). The eigenvalues correspond
  to the magnitude of variancealong the principal components.
  Interpretability is a negative. PCA is completely nonparametric: any
  data set can be plugged in and an answer comes out, requiring no
  parameters to tweak and no regard for how the data was recorded. From
  one perspective, the fact that PCA is non-parametric (or
  plug-and-play) can be considered a positive feature because the answer
  is unique and independent of the user. From another perspective the
  fact that PCA is agnostic to the source of the data is also a
  weakness. When using dimensional reduction we restrict ourselves to
  simpler models. Thus, we expect bias to increase and variance to
  decrease. Getting latent components. Visualize high dimensional data.
  Reduce noise. Preprocessing. scale and center data before doing. Needs
  regularization. Too many principal components F1 score starts to drop
  after increase. Best F1 is 1. set number of components. Use
  fit\_transforms, use explained\_variance\_ratio\_ to see how much of
  the variance is explained by each component. Choose features that
  explain most of the variances, then use a inverse\_transform to
  reconstruct your x. Minimum number of principal components is
  min(n,p).
\item
  pca: It accounts for as much of the variability in the data as
  possible by considering highly correlated features. Each succeeding
  component in turn has the highest variance using the features that are
  less correlated with the first principal component and that are
  orthogonal to the preceding component.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other}\label{other-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
  \tightlist
  \item
    look at variance: apply(USArrests , 2, var) \textbar{} 2) pca \&
    scale: pca = prcomp(USArrests , scale = TRUE) \textbar{} 3) plot:
    biplot(pca, scale = 0)
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  pca\$rotation contains the principal component loadings matrix which
  explains proportion of each variable along each principal component.
\item
  Kaiser-Harris criterion suggests retaining PCs with eigenvalues
  \textgreater{} 1; PCs with eigenvalues \textless{} 1 explain less
  variance than contained in a single variable. Cattell Scree test
  visually inspects the elbow graph for diminishing return; retain PCs
  before a drastic drop-off.
\end{itemize}

PC columns contain loadings; correlations of the observed variables with
the Pcs. h2 column displays the component comunalities; amount of
variance explained by the components.

Note: Look at factorplot. Shows pot of relationship between variables
and principal components.

It is also possible to decompress the reduced dataset back to 784
dimensions by applying the inverse transformation of the PCA projection.
Of course this won't give you back the original data, since the
projection lost a bit of information (within the 5\% variance that was
dropped), but it will likely be quite close to the original data. The
mean squared distance between the original data and the reconstructed
data (compressed and then decompressed) is called the reconstruction
error.

It turns out that many things behave very differently in
high-dimensional space. For example, if you pick a random point in a
unit square (a 1 × 1 square), it will have only about a 0.4\% chance of
being located less than 0.001 from a border (in other words, it is very
unlikely that a random point will be ``extreme'' along any dimension).
But in a 10,000-dimensional unit hypercube (a 1 × 1 × ⋯ × 1 cube, with
ten thousand 1s), this probability is greater than 99.999999\%. Most
points in a high-dimensional hypercube are very close to the border.

Before looking at the PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction in more
detail, let's summarize the approach in a few simple steps: Standardize
the -dimensional dataset.

Construct the covariance matrix.Decompose the covariance matrix into its
eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Select eigenvectors that correspond to the
largest eigenvalues, where is the dimensionality of the new feature
subspace ().

Construct a projection matrix from the ``''top``'' eigenvectors.

Transform the -dimensional input dataset using the projection matrix to
obtain the new -dimensional feature subspace.

Probabilistic PCA introduces the Gaussian distribution to the PCA
modeling framework.

Kernel PCA must project data into a higher dimensional space than that
of the original data.

\section{KNN}\label{knn}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-6}

Calculate distance between each observation and all the others.
Determine the k nearest observations to the observation. Classify the
observation as the most frequent class of the k nearest observations.
Small k's are not robust to outliers, highlight local variations and
induce unstable decision boundaries. Large k's are robust to outliers,
highlight global variations and induce stable decision boundaries. Good
value to choose is k = sqrt(n). Can use maximum prior probability to
decide ties. Use Euclidean distance for numerical data and Hamming
distance for categorical data. Latter treats dimensions equally and is
symmetric. Low k is low bias, high variance and high k is high bias low
variance. 1NN can't adapt to outliers and has no notion of class
frequencies. Can use weighted KNN. Easy in sklearn.

curse of dimensionality, overfitting, correlated features, cost to
update, sensitivity of distance metrics

smaller k means smaller training error, ut larger k is more stable.

\subsection{Characteristics}\label{characteristics-2}

\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-5}

\subsection{Pros/Cons}\label{proscons-6}

\textbf{Pros}

Only assumption is proximity. Non-parametric.

The only assumption we are making about our data is related to proximity
(i. e., observations that are close by in the feature space are similar
to each other in respect to the target value). We do not have to fit a
model to the data since this is a non-parametric approach.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Powerful
\item
  No training involved (``lazy'')
\item
  Naturally handles multiclass classification and regression
\end{itemize}

What is a common drawback of 3NN classifiers? Prediction on large data
sets is slow.

\textbf{Cons}

Have to decide k and distance metric. Can be sensitive to outliers or
irrelevant attributes. Computationally expensive.

knn is terrible with high dimensions. Bad with categorical data.

Expensive and slow to predict new instances - Must define a meaningful
distance function - Performs poorly on high-dimensionality datasets

We have to decide on K and a distance metric.

Can be sensitive to outliers or irrelevant attributes because they add
noise.

Computationally expensive; as the number of observations, dimensions,
and K increases, the time it takes for the algorithm to run and the
space it takes to store the computations increases dramatically.

\section{SVM}\label{svm}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-7}

Selection of margin in SVM is a convex optimization problem. What is the
objective of the maximum margin approach? To ensure small prediction
error when the underlying distribution is not known

The LinearSVC class regularizes the bias term, so you should center the
training set first by subtracting its mean. This is automatic if you
scale the data using the StandardScaler. Moreover, make sure you set the
loss hyperparameter to ``hinge'', as it is not the default value.
Finally, for better performance you should set the dual hyperparameter
to False, unless there are more features than training instances (we
will discuss duality later in the chapter).

With so many kernels to choose from, how can you decide which one to
use? As a rule of thumb, you should always try the linear kernel first
(remember that LinearSVC is much faster than SVC(kernel=``linear'')),
especially if the training set is very large or if it has plenty of
features. If the training set is not too large, you should try the
Gaussian RBF kernel as well; it works well in most cases. Then if you
have spare time and computing power, you can also experiment with a few
other kernels using cross-validation and grid search, especially if
there are kernels specialized for your training set's data structure.

Here mostly talking about a maximal margin classifier. A separating
hyperline of data of two classes. Maximizes distance to the nearest
point in either class, i.e, the margin. Points which delineate the
boundary are called support vectors. Correct classification first and
then maximizing the margin. SVM only really works well with linear
hyperplanes. The c hyperparameter deals with the tradeoff between a
smooth decision boundary and correct classification. The larger the c
the more points classified correctly as it increases the penalty for
wrong classification. A smaller c gives more room for intial error which
helps improve accuracy for not easily separable data. Work well in
complicated domains with clear line of separation. Not so well in for
large datasets because of training and not when there is a lot of noise.
Can solve nonlinear decision boundaries by using polynomial terms.
Kernel trick that draws boundaries by looking into higher dimensions.

Extracting the coefficients from the hyperplane equation (not including
the intercept) yields what is called a normal vector. This vector points
in a direction orthogonal to the surface of the hyperplane and
essentially defines its orientation.

Big data set and lot of features SVM might be slow and prone to
overfitting. SVM slower than naïve bayes. A kernelis a function that
quantifies the similarity of two observations. The beauty of the
``kernel trick'' is that, even if there is an infinite-dimensional
basis, we need only look at the n\^{}2 inner products between training
data points. SVM not scale invariant. Check if library normalizes by
default. RBF kernel is a good default. Try exponential sequences for
parameters.

Extension of above info about relaxing margin. Doesn't perfectly
separate classes but is more robust to outliers. Helps better classify
obervations. Take a penalty by potentially misclassifying soe
observations. Have better predictive power. Called a soft margin. The C
parameter is the budget for the slack variables which tell where
observations are relative to the margin and hyperplane. Only
observations that either fall on the margin or violate the margin affect
the solution to the optimization problem. More robust than SVM.

When the support vector classifier is combined with a non-linear kernel,
the resulting classifier is called a support vector machine.

Note: Important to make sure the normal vector is of unit length. For
the radial kernel, suppose we have a test observation. If it is far from
a training observation, the Euclidean distance will be large, but the
value of the radial kernel will be small. using kernels is much more
computationally efficientbecause we only need to compute the kernel for
distinct pairs of observations in our dataset. Furthermore, we need not
actually work in the enlarged feature space. Intuitively, the gamma
parameter defines how far the influence of a single training example
reaches, with low values meaning `far' and high values meaning `close'.
The gamma parameters can be seen as the inverse of the radius of
influence of samples selected by the model as support vectors.

Multiclass

1v1: Construct a support vector machine for each pair of categories. For
each classifier, record the prediction for each observation. Have the
classifiers vote on the prediction for each observation.

1vAll: Construct a support vector machine for each individual category
against all other categories combined. Assign the observation to the
classifier with the largest function value.

\end{itemize}

\section{Decision Tree}\label{decision-tree}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-8}

So should you use Gini impurity or entropy? The truth is, most of the
time it does not make a big difference: they lead to similar trees. Gini
impurity is slightly faster to compute, so it is a good default.
However, when they differ, Gini impurity tends to isolate the most
frequent class in its own branch of the tree, while entropy tends to
produce slightly more balanced trees.

Decision Trees make very few assumptions about the training data (as
opposed to linear models, which obviously assume that the data is
linear, for example). Such a model is often called a nonparametric
model, not because it does not have any parameters (it often has a lot)
but because the number of parameters is not determined prior to
training, so the model structure is free to stick closely to the data.

More generally, the main issue with Decision Trees is that they are very
sensitive to small variations in the training data. For example, if you
just remove the widest Iris-Versicolor from the iris training set (the
one with petals 4.8 cm long and 1.8 cm wide) and train a new Decision
Tree, you may get the model represented in Figure~6-8. As you can see,
it looks very different from the previous Decision Tree (Figure~6-2).
Actually, since the training algorithm used by Scikit-Learn is
stochastic6 you may get very different models even on the same training
data (unless you set the random\_state hyperparameter).

Construct solutions that stratify the feature space into relatively easy
to describe regions. Partition predictor space into rectangular or
box-like regions. For regression predict the meant of the reponse
variables in each region for the training observations in that space.
Top down and greedy approach called recursive binary spltting to find
ebst solution. Greedy because splits based on best result. The recursive
binary splitting process depends on the greatest reduction in the RSS.
Entropy very important. Decides where tree splits. Measure of impurity
in examples. Entropy between 0 and 1. 0 means no impurity. Maximial is 1
when there is an even split between options. Key term: information gain.
Decisions tree maximize this. Easy to interpret, prone to overfitting.
Where each data point has its own node, the variance is high and the
training error is 0. Deciding on the number of splits prior to building
a tree isn't the best strategy. The best subtree will be the one that
yields the lowest test error rate. Given a subtree, we can estimate the
test error by implementing the crossvalidationprocess, but this is too
cumbersome because the large number of possible subtrees. The tuning
parameter alpha helps balance the tradeoff between the overall
complexity of the tree and its fit to the training data. Small values of
alpha yield trees that are quite extensive (have many terminal nodes).
Large values of alpha yield trees that are quite limited (have few
terminal nodes). Similar to ridge/lasso regression. Ultimately, the
subtree that is used for prediction is built using all of the available
data with the determined optimal value of alpha.

Regression: Use cost complexity pruning to build set of subtrees as a
function of lambda. Classification: Use Gini index, measures total
variance among classes.

Note: Duplicate splits happen when they increase node purity. While
pruning reduces the variance of the overall tree model upon repeated
builds with different datasets, we induce biasbecause the trees are much
simpler.

\section{Bagging}\label{bagging}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-9}

used to decrease variance in decision trees

How it works: train multiple trees using bootstrapped datasets,
regression trees: average the predictions from all the trees,
classification: take a majority vote of the predictions, majority vote:
the class which occurs most frequently, Out of bag (OOB) error, Only a
portion of the data is used to train each tree, The remaining data which
wasn't selected can be used to assess the tree's performance, (the
response for each observation is predicted using only the trees that
were not fit using that observation)

Bagging involves randomly generating Bootstrap samples from the dataset
and trains the models individually. Predictions are then made by
aggregating or averaging all the response variables:For example,
consider a dataset (Xi, Yi), where i=1 \ldots{}n, contains n data
points.Now, randomly select B samples with replacements from the
original dataset using Bootstrap technique.Next, train the B samples
with regression/classification models independently. Then, predictions
are made on the test set by averaging the responses from all the B
models generated in the case of regression. Alternatively, the most
often occurring class among B samples is generated in the case of
classification.

Bagging stabilizes decision trees and improves accuracy by reducing
variance.

Bagging reduces generalization error.

Take repeated samples of the same size from the single overall training
dataset. Treat these different sets of data as pseudo-training sets.
Fitting separate, independent decision treesto each of the bootstrapped
training data sets. We can then average all predictions (or take the
majority vote) to obtain the bagged estimate. Instead of pruning back
our trees, create very large trees in the first place. These large trees
will tend to have low bias, but high variance. Retain the low bias, but
get rid of the high variance by averaging. Con is that the trees are
correlation. train multiple trees using bootstrapped data to reduce
variance and prevent overfitting

\subsection{Pros/Cons}\label{proscons-9}

\textbf{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  reduces variance in comparison to regular decision trees
\item
  Can provide variable importance measures: classification: Gini index +
  regression: RSS
\item
  Can easily handle qualitative (categorical) features
\item
  Out of bag (OOB) estimates can be used for model validation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cons}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Not as easy to visually interpret
\item
  Does not reduce variance if the features are correlated
\end{itemize}

\section{Random Forest}\label{random-forest}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-10}

Build a number of decision trees using bootstrapped samples

At each split in the tree only a portion of the features are considered

a feature is selected from a subset of features not the whole feature
space

the subset is usually sqrt(n.features)

This allows trees to be built without some of the strong features
decorrelates the trees, unlike bagging

Random forests are improvised supervised algorithms than bootstrap
aggregation or bagging methods, though they are built on a similar
approach. Unlike selecting all the variables in all the B samples
generated using the Bootstrap technique in bagging, we select only a few
predictor variables randomly from the total variables for each of the B
samples. Then, these samples are trained with the models. Predictions
are made by averaging the result of each model. The number of predictors
in each sample is decided using the formula m = √p, where p is the total
variable count in the original dataset.Here are some key
\url{notes:This} approach removes the condition of dependency of strong
predictors in the dataset as we intentionally select fewer variables.

Draw a random bootstrap sample of size n (randomly choose n samples from
the training set with replacement).Grow a decision tree from the
bootstrap sample. At each node:Randomly select d features without
replacement.Split the node using the feature that provides the best
split according to the objective function, for instance, by maximizing
the information gain.Repeat the steps 1 to 2 k times.Aggregate the
prediction by each tree to assign the class label by majority vote.
Majority voting will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, Combining
Different Models for Ensemble Learning.

Random forests further improve decision tree performance by
de-correlating the individual trees in the bagging ensemble.

Random forests decorrelate tree it generates and thus results in a
reduction in variance. Similar to bagging, we first build various
decision trees on bootstrapped training samples, but we split internal
nodes in a special way. Each time a split is considered within the
construction of a decision tree, only a random subset of ᬊthe overall
predictors are allowed to be candidates. At every split, a new subset of
predictors is randomly selected. The random forest procedure forces the
decision tree building process to use different predictors to split at
different times. Should a good predictor be left out of consideration
for some splits, it still has many chances to be consideredin the
construction of other splits. We can't overfit by adding more trees. The
variance just ends up decreasing. Out of bag score is a good estimate of
the test score and is the non-bootstrapped data. Need to turn on this
scoing method. Error Rate: Depends on correlation between trees (higher
is worse), strength of single trees (higher is better). Increasing
number of features for each split increases correlation and strength of
single trees.

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-9}

\subsection{Characteristics}\label{characteristics-6}

\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-9}

\subsection{Pros/Cons}\label{proscons-10}

\textbf{Pros}

Decorrelates trees (relative to boosted trees)

important when dealing with mulitple features which may be correlated

reduced variance (relative to regular trees)

All purpose model that performs well on most problems. Automatically
chooses the best features. High accuracy.

\textbf{Cons}

Hard to interpret and needs a lot of work to tune parameters.

Not as easy to visually interpret

\section{Boosting}\label{boosting}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-11}

Unlike boosting and random forests, can overfit if number of trees is
too large

Similar to bagging, but trees are grown sequentially. Each tree is
created using information from previously grown trees

Each tree is generated using information from previously grown trees;
the addition of a new tree improves upon the performance of the previous
trees. The trees are now dependentupon one another. Boosting approach
tends to slowly learn our data. Given a current decision tree model, we
fit a new decision tree to the residualsof the current decision tree.
The new decision tree (based on the residuals) is then added to the
current decision tree, and the residuals are updated. We limit the
number of terminal nodes in order to sequentially fit small trees. By
fitting small trees to the residuals, we slowly improve the overall
model in areas where it does not perform well.

Note: Unlike in bagging and random forests, boosting can overfit if ᫦is
large (although very slowly). Use cross-validation to select number of
trees᫦. Alpha controls the rate at which boosting learns and is usually
between 0.01 to 0.001. A small alpha usually goes with a large number of
trees. Can also choose the number of splits. Typically using stumps
(single splits d = 1) is sufficient and results in an additive model.

Note on Variable Importance: For regression trees, we can use the
reduction in the RSS. For classification trees, we can use the reduction
in the Gini index. A relatively large value indicates a notable drop in
the RSS or Gini index, and thus a better fit to the data; corresponding
variables are relatively important predictors.

Similar to bagging, but learns sequentially and builds off previous
trees

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-10}

\subsection{Characteristics}\label{characteristics-7}

\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-10}

\subsection{Pros/Cons}\label{proscons-11}

\textbf{Pros}

Somewhat more interpretable than boosted trees/random forest as the user
can define the size of each tree resulting in a collection of stumps (1
level) which can be viewed as an additive model

Can easily handle qualitative (categorical) features

\textbf{Cons}

\section{Association Rule Mining}\label{association-rule-mining}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-12}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Used in Genetics, Fraud, and Market Basket Analysis, etc. A typical
  rule might be: if someone buys peanut butter and jelly, then that
  person is likely to buy bread as well.
\item
  Tutorial: \url{http://pbpython.com/market-basket-analysis.html}
\item
  Incredibly big feature space (2\^{}k-1).
\item
  The Apriori algorithm employs a simple a priori belief as a guideline
  for reducing the association rule space.
\item
  Support: the fraction of which each item appears within the dataset as
  a whole. Support(item) = count(item)/N. Higher support is better.
\item
  nfidence: the likelihood that a constructed rule is correct given the
  items on the left hand side of the transaction. A higher level of
  confidence implies a higher likelihood that Y appears alongside
  transactions in which X appears.
\item
  ft: the ratio by which the confidence of a rule exceeds the expected
  outcome. When lift \textgreater{} 1, the presence of X seems to have
  increasedthe probability of Y occurring in the transaction. When lift
  \textless{} 1, the presence of X seems to have decreasedthe
  probability of Y occurring in the transaction. When lift = 1, X and Y
  are independent.
\item
  t thresholds for support and confidence and then the algorithm goes
  from all 1-combinations to 2-combinations and up. Those subset below
  the threshold don't make it to the higher iterations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Assumptions}\label{assumptions-11}

\subsection{Characteristics}\label{characteristics-8}

\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-11}

\subsection{Pros/Cons}\label{proscons-12}

\textbf{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Ideally suited for working with very large amounts of transactional
  data.
\item
  The results are rules that are generally easy to understand and have a
  high amount of interpretability.
\item
  The process is useful for data mining and uncovering unexpected
  knowledge within a dataset.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cons}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The outcome is usually not interesting when applied to smaller
  datasets.
\item
  It is difficult to separate actual insights from common sense notions.
\item
  The analyst might be compelled to draw spurious conclusions--remember
  that correlation doesn't imply causation!
\end{itemize}

\section{Naïve Bayes}\label{naive-bayes}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-13}

Practitioners do use Naive Bayes regularly for ranking, where the actual
values of the probabilities are not relevant---only the relative values
for examples in the different classes. Another advantage of Naive Bayes
is that it is naturally an ``incremental learner.'' An incremental
learner is an induction technique that can update its model one training
example at a time. It does not need to reprocess all past training
examples when new training data become available.

Document/spam classification is one use. Assumptions are that all the
features are equally likely and are all important. Would be
computational expensive without these assumptions with having to track
all the joint probabilities. Gaussian for continuous variables,
Bernoulli for binary input, and Multinomial for binary and more input.
Use MLE to estimate parameters for Gaussian. Bernoulli/Multinomial used
for spam classification.The Laplace Estimator (usually chosen to be 1)
is a corrective measure that adds a small amount of error to each of the
counts in the frequency table of words. The addition of error ensures
that each resulting probability of each event will necessarily be
nonzero, even if the event did not appear in the training data.

Note: In addition, we can use function ``partial\_fit'' to fit on a
batch of samples incrementally while we are using. MultinomialNB and
Bernoulli NB also support sample weighting.

\subsection{Characteristics}\label{characteristics-9}

\subsection{Evaluation}\label{evaluation-12}

\subsection{Pros/Cons}\label{proscons-13}

\textbf{Pros}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  It is relatively simple to understand. Training the classifier does
  not require many observations, and the method also works well with
  large amounts of data. It is easy to obtain the estimated
  probabilityfor a classification prediction.
\item
  Computationally fast
\item
  Simple to implement
\item
  Works well with high dimensions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Cons}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Relies on independence assumption and will perform badly if this
  assumption is not met
\item
  While easily attainable, the estimated probabilities are often less
  reliable than the predicted class labels themselves.
\end{itemize}

\section{LDA}\label{lda}

\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-14}

Before we take a look into the inner workings of LDA in the following
subsections, let's summarize the key steps of the LDA approach:

Standardize the -dimensional dataset ( is the number of features).

For each class, compute the -dimensional mean vector.

Construct the between-class scatter matrix and the within-class scatter
matrix .

Compute the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues of the matrix .

Choose the eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues to
construct a -dimensional transformation matrix ; the eigenvectors are
the columns of this matrix.

Project the samples onto the new feature subspace using the
transformation matrix.

LDA similar to Naive Bayes but doesn't assume variables are independent,
assumes that p(x\textbar{}y) is a multivariate normal distribution, and
assumes gaussian distributions for each class share the same covariance
matrix. If they don't share the same covariance matrix, then we use
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis which assumes each class has its own.

lmerTest

Analysis of Variance, or ANOVA, can be used to compare two different
lmer models and test if one model explains more variability than the
other model. We can use this to compare two lmer models. For example, if
we wanted to see if Year is important for predicting Crime in Maryland,
we can build a null model with only County as a random-effect and a year
model that includes Year.

\section{Models}\label{models}

Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are the two most widely used
approaches to time series forecasting, and provide complementary
approaches to the problem. While exponential smoothing models are based
on a description of the trend and seasonality in the data, ARIMA models
aim to describe the autocorrelations in the data.

Benchmark models: Mean, naive, seasonal naive

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{-1}
\item
  Mean
\item
  Naive: Set all forecasts to be the value of the last observation. This
  method works remarkably well for many economic and financial time
  series. Because a naive forecast is optimal when data follow a random
  walk, these are also called random walk forecasts. naive()
\item
  Seasonal Naive: Assumes magnitude of the seasonal pattern is constant.
  snaive()
\end{enumerate}

Linear

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{9}
\item
  regression: tslm(): trend and season are not objects in the R
  workspace; they are created automatically by tslm() when specified in
  this way: tslm(beer2 \textasciitilde{} trend + season). It is not
  recommended that quadratic or higher order trends be used in
  forecasting. When they are extrapolated, the resulting forecasts are
  often unrealistic.
\item
  harmonic regression: An alternative to using seasonal dummy variables,
  especially for long seasonal periods, is to use Fourier terms. ith
  Fourier terms, we often need fewer predictors than with dummy
  variables, especially when m is large. This makes them useful for
  weekly data, for example, where m ≈ 52. For short seasonal periods
  (e.g., quarterly data), there is little advantage in using Fourier
  terms over seasonal dummy variables. fourier() - tslm(beer2
  \textasciitilde{} trend + fourier(beer2, K=2))
\item
  Dynamic Regression
\end{enumerate}

The R function Arima() will fit a regression model with ARIMA errors if
the argument xreg is used. The order argument specifies the order of the
ARIMA error model. If differencing is specified, then the differencing
is applied to all variables in the regression model before the model is
estimated.

Arima(y, xreg=x, order=c(1,1,0))
auto.arima(uschange{[},``Consumption''{]},
xreg=uschange{[},``Income''{]})

There are two different ways of modelling a linear trend: deterministic
and stochastic.

deterministic: fit1 \textless{}- auto.arima(austa, d=0, xreg=trend)

stochastic: fit2 \textless{}- auto.arima(austa, d=1)

There is an implicit assumption with deterministic trends that the slope
of the trend is not going to change over time. On the other hand,
stochastic trends can change, and the estimated growth is only assumed
to be the average growth over the historical period, not necessarily the
rate of growth that will be observed into the future. Consequently, it
is safer to forecast with stochastic trends, especially for longer
forecast horizons, as the prediction intervals allow for greater
uncertainty in future growth.

When there are long seasonal periods, a dynamic regression with Fourier
terms is often better than other models we have considered in this book.

Seasonal differencing of high order does not make a lot of sense --- for
daily data it involves comparing what happened today with what happened
exactly a year ago and there is no constraint that the seasonal pattern
is smooth.

So for such time series, we prefer a harmonic regression approach where
the seasonal pattern is modelled using Fourier terms with short-term
time series dynamics handled by an ARMA error.

fit \textless{}- auto.arima(cafe04, xreg = fourier(cafe04, K = i),
seasonal = FALSE, lambda = 0)

ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonality) Models

This label can also be thought of as ExponenTial Smoothing. The
possibilities for each component are: Error = \{a.m\}, Trend =
\{n,a,a\_d\}, and Seasonal = \{n,a,m\}. Therefore, for each component in
the ETS system, we can assign None, Multiplicative, or Additive (or N,
M, A) for each of the three components in our time series.

Three of the combinations of (Error, Trend, Seasonal) can lead to
numerical difficulties. Specifically, the models that can cause such
instabilities are ETS(A,N,M), ETS(A,A,M), and ETS(A,A d ,M), due to
division by values potentially close to zero in the state equations. We
normally do not consider these particular combinations when selecting a
model.

Models with multiplicative errors are useful when the data are strictly
positive, but are not numerically stable when the data contain zeros or
negative values. Therefore, multiplicative error models will not be
considered if the time series is not strictly positive. In that case,
only the six fully additive models will be applied.

The ets() function does not produce forecasts. Rather, it estimates the
model parameters and returns information about the fitted model. By
default it uses the AICc to select an appropriate model

ETS point forecasts are equal to the medians of the forecast
distributions. For models with only additive components, the forecast
distributions are normal, so the medians and means are equal. For ETS
models with multiplicative errors, or with multiplicative seasonality,
the point forecasts will not be equal to the means of the forecast
distributions.

auto.arima() does an auto fit.

When fitting an ARIMA model to a set of (non-seasonal) time series data,
the following procedure provides a useful general approach.

Plot the data and identify any unusual observations.

If necessary, transform the data (using a Box-Cox transformation) to
stabilize the variance.

If the data are non-stationary, take first differences of the data until
the data are stationary.

Examine the ACF/PACF: Is an ARIMA(p,d,0) or ARIMA(0,d,q) model
appropriate?

Try your chosen model(s), and use the AICc to search for a better model.

Check the residuals from your chosen model by plotting the ACF of the
residuals, and doing a portmanteau test of the residuals. If they do not
look like white noise, try a modified model.

Once the residuals look like white noise, calculate forecasts.

auto.arima only does steps 3-5.

If the data are from an ARIMA(p,d,0) or ARIMA(0,d,q) model, then the ACF
and PACF plots can be helpful in determining the value of p/q. If p and
q are both positive, then the plots do not help in finding suitable
values of p and q.

The data may follow an ARIMA(p,d,0) model if the ACF and PACF plots of
the differenced data show the following patterns:

the ACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal; there is a significant
spike at lag p in the PACF, but none beyond lag p.

The data may follow an ARIMA(0,d,q) model if the ACF and PACF plots of
the differenced data show the following patterns:

the PACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal; there is a significant
spike at lag q in the ACF, but none beyond lag q.

The seasonal part of an AR or MA model will be seen in the seasonal lags
of the PACF and ACF. For example, an ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,0,1)\_12 model will
show:

a spike at lag 12 in the ACF but no other significant spikes;
exponential decay in the seasonal lags of the PACF (i.e., at lags 12,
24, 36, \ldots{}).

Logarithms are useful because they are interpretable: changes in a log
value are relative (or percentage) changes on the original scale. So if
log base 10 is used, then an increase of 1 on the log scale corresponds
to a multiplication of 10 on the original scale. Another useful feature
of log transformations is that they constrain the forecasts to stay
positive on the original scale. A log transformation can address
heteroskedasticity.

we recommend that one of the AICc, AIC, or CV statistics be used, each

When comparing forecast methods applied to a single time series, or to
several time series with the same units, the MAE is popular as it is
easy to both understand and compute. A forecast method that minimizes
the MAE will lead to forecasts of the median, while minimizing the RMSE
will lead to forecasts of the mean. Consequently, the RMSE is also
widely used, despite being more difficult to interpret. Percentage
errors have the advantage of being unit-free, and so are frequently used
to compare forecast performances between data sets. The most commonly
used measure is Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) or symmetric MAPE.
forecast errors are different from residuals in two ways. First,
residuals are calculated on the training set while forecast errors are
calculated on the test set. Second, residuals are based on one-step
forecasts while forecast errors can involve multi-step forecasts.

A good forecasting method will yield residuals with the following
properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  The residuals are uncorrelated. If there are correlations between
  residuals, then there is information left in the residuals which
  should be used in computing forecasts.
\item
  The residuals have zero mean. If the residuals have a mean other than
  zero, then the forecasts are biased. (Adjusting for bias is easy: if
  the residuals have mean m then add m to all forecasts and the bias
  problem is solved.)
\item
  It is useful (but not necessary) for the residuals to also have the
  following two properties: the residuals have constant variance and are
  normally distributed.

-Notes

Fourier terms in lm good for intraday data.

Methods with multiplicative trend produce poor forecasts.

For stock market prices and indexes, the best forecasting method is
often the naïve method. Use also dynamic regression.

Create time series with ts(mydata{[}-1{]}, start = c(1981, 1), frequency
= 4)

Time series that show no auto-correlation are called white noise. For
white noise series, we expect each auto-correlation to be close to zero.
For a white noise series, we expect 95\% of the spikes in the ACF to lie
within +/- 2 * sqrt(T) where T is the length of the time series.

The possible time series (TS) scenarios can be recognized by asking the
following questions: 1) TS has a trend? If yes, is the trend increasing
linearly or exponentially? 2) TS has seasonality? If yes, do the
seasonal components increase in magnitude over time?

Additive model for linear trend and multiplicative model for exponential
trend. Additive for trend and Multiplicative and Additive for seasonal
components. For trends that are exponential, we would need to use a
multiplicative model. For increasing seasonality components, we would
need to use a multiplicative model model as well.

Therefore we can generalize all of these models using a naming system
for ETS:

Error is the error line we saw in the time series decomposition part
earlier in the course. If the error is increasing similar to an
increasing seasonal components, we would need to consider a
multiplicative design for the exponential model.

A time series model that has a constant error, linear trend, and
increasing seasonal components means we would need to use an ETS model
of ETS(N,A,M)

A time series model that has increasing error, exponential trend, and no
seasonality means we would need to use an ETS model of:

non-stationary: This plot shows an upward trend and seasonality.

stationary: This plot revolves around a constant mean of 0 and shows
contained variance.

-Metrics

Percentage errors, like MAPE, are useful because they are scale
independent, so they can be used to compare forecasts between different
data series, unlike scale dependent errors. The disadvantage is that it
cannot be used if the series has zero values.

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is also often useful for purposes
of reporting, because it is expressed in generic percentage terms it
will make sense even to someone who has no idea what constitutes a
``big'' error in terms of dollars spent or widgets sold.

Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) is another relative measure of error
that is applicable only to time series data. It is defined as the mean
absolute error of the model divided by the the mean absolute value of
the first difference of the series. Thus, it measures the relative
reduction in error compared to a naive model. Ideally its value will be
significantly less than 1 but is relative to comparison across other
models for the same series. Since this error measurement is relative and
can be applied across models, it is accepted as one of the best metrics
for error measurement.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Seasonal Decomposition; Use additive model when the magnitude of the
  seasonal fluctuations surrounding the general trend doesn't vary over
  time. Use the multiplicative model when the magnitude of the seasonal
  fluctuations surrounding the general trend appear to change in a
  proportional manner over time. Go from additive to multiplicative with
  a log transformation.
\item
  White noise: Describes the assumption that each element in the time
  series is a random draw from N(0, constant variance). Also called a

  stationary.

\textbf{ARIMA(p,d,q) (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) Models}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  AR(p): auto-regressive component for lags on the stationary series.
  The AR models sayd that the value of a variable at a specific time is
  related to the value of the variable at previous times.
\item
  I(d): Integrated component for a series that needs to be differenced.
\item
  MA(q): Moving average component for lag of the forecast errors. In a
  moving average model of order q, each value in a time series is
  predicted from the linear combination of the previous q errors. The
  value of a variable at a specific time is related to the residuals of
  prediction at previous times.
\item
  In an auto-regressive model of order p, each valeu in a time series is
  predicted from a linear combination of the previous p values.
\item
  Procedure: Make stationary if necessary by differencing. Determine
  possible values of p and q. Assess model fit and try other values of p
  and q to overfit. Make forecasts with the final model.
\item
  Augmented Dicky-Fuller Test: This tests whether or not a time series
  is stationary. h0: series is not stationary, ha: the series is
  stationary.
\item
  Determine p and q: Look at autocorrelation (AC) and partial
  correlation (PAC) functions. AC measures the way observations relate
  to each other. PAC measure the way observations relate to each other
  after accounting for all other intervening observations. Plot of the
  autocorrelation function (ACF) displays correlation of the series with
  itself at different lags. A plot of the PAC displays the amount of
  autocorrelation not explained by lower order correlations. Spikes in
  the PACF will choose for AR(p). Spikes in the ACF will choose MA(q).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Assess Model Fit}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Appropriate model should resemble white noise. Check scatterplot of
  residuals vs fit to check constant variance and qqplot to check
  normality. Autocorrelations should be zero to check for violation of
  independent errors.
\item
  Box-Ljung Test: Check if all autocorrelations are zero, i.e the series
  is of white noise. H0: autocorrelations are all 0. ha: At least one is
  nonzero.
\item
  Overfit model with extra AR/MA terms and compare using AIC/BIC.
\item
  Interpretation: AR coefficient closer to 1 means series returns to
  mean slowly, vice versa for closer to 0.
\item
  MA(1) coefficient indicates how much the shock of the previous time
  period is retained in the current time period. MA(2) refers to the
  previous two time periods.

Time series that show no autocorrelation are called white noise.

For white noise series, we expect each autocorrelation to be close to
zero. Of course, they will not be exactly equal to zero as there is some
random variation. For a white noise series, we expect 95\% of the spikes
in the ACF to lie within\\
+/- 2 * sqrt(T) where T is the length of the time series.

For naïve forecasts, we simply set all forecasts to be the value of the
last observation. This method works remarkably well for many economic
and financial time series. Because a naïve forecast is optimal when data
follow a random walk (see Section 8.1), these are also called random
walk forecasts.

mean, naive, and seasonal naive are benchmarks.

feature engineering: scaling by monthday(), by population, inflation for
money, log, boxCox()/boxCox.lambda(), power transforms, bias
adjustments: mean of forecast distribution instead of median for
back-transformed forecast,

Bias adjustment is not done by default in the forecast package. If you
want your forecasts to be means rather than medians, use the argument
biasadj=TRUE when you select your Box-Cox transformation parameter.

Logarithms are useful because they are interpretable: changes in a log
value are relative (or percentage) changes on the original scale. So if
log base 10 is used, then an increase of 1 on the log scale corresponds
to a multiplication of 10 on the original scale. Another useful feature
of log transformations is that they constrain the forecasts to stay
positive on the original scale.

A good forecasting method will yield residuals with the following
properties:

The residuals are uncorrelated. If there are correlations between
residuals, then there is information left in the residuals which should
be used in computing forecasts.

The residuals have zero mean. If the residuals have a mean other than
zero, then the forecasts are biased.

Adjusting for bias is easy: if the residuals have mean m then add m to
all forecasts and the bias problem is solved.

It is useful (but not necessary) for the residuals to also have the
following two properties: the residuals have constant variance and are
normally distributed.

For stock market prices and indexes, the best forecasting method is
often the naïve method.

Recall that r\_k is the autocorrelation for lag k . When we look at the
ACF plot to see whether each spike is within the required limits, we are
implicitly carrying out multiple hypothesis tests, each one with a small
probability of giving a false positive. When enough of these tests are
done, it is likely that at least one will give a false positive, and so
we may conclude that the residuals have some remaining autocorrelation,
when in fact they do not. In order to overcome this problem, we test
whether the first h autocorrelations are significantly different from
what would be expected from a white noise process. A test for a group of
autocorrelations is called a portmanteau test, from a French word
describing a suitcase containing a number of items. Use
Box-Pierce/Ljung-Box test.

Large values of suggest that the autocorrelations do not come from a
white noise series.

All of these methods for checking residuals are conveniently packaged
into one R function checkresiduals(), which will produce a time plot,
ACF plot and histogram of the residuals (with an overlayed normal
distribution for comparison), and do a Ljung-Box test with the correct
degrees of freedom.

train-test split: window()/subset()

forecast errors are different from residuals in two ways. First,
residuals are calculated on the training set while forecast errors are
calculated on the test set. Second, residuals are based on one-step
forecasts while forecast errors can involve multi-step forecasts.

When comparing forecast methods applied to a single time series, or to
several time series with the same units, the MAE is popular as it is
easy to both understand and compute. A forecast method that minimizes
the MAE will lead to forecasts of the median, while minimizing the RMSE
will lead to forecasts of the mean. Consequently, the RMSE is also
widely used, despite being more difficult to interpret. Percentage
errors have the advantage of being unit-free, and so are frequently used
to compare forecast performances between data sets. The most commonly
used measure is Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) or symmetric MAPE.

accuracy()

With time series forecasting, one-step forecasts may not be as relevant
as multi-step forecasts. In this case, the cross-validation procedure
based on a rolling forecasting origin can be modified to allow
multi-step errors to be used.

tsCV()

a prediction interval gives an interval within which we expect y\_t to
lie with a specified probability.

When forecasting one step ahead, the standard deviation of the forecast
distribution is almost the same as the standard deviation of the
residuals.

forecast(): You can use this directly if you have no idea which model to
use, or use it to produce forecasts after fitting a model.

\subsection{C4}\label{c4}

There are three general settings in which judgmental forecasting is
used: (i) there are no available data, so that statistical methods are
not applicable and judgmental forecasting is the only feasible approach;
(ii) data are available, statistical forecasts are generated, and these
are then adjusted using judgement; and (iii) data are available and
statistical and judgmental forecasts are generated independently and
then combined.

\subsection{C5}\label{c5}

tslm()

Another useful test of autocorrelation in the residuals designed to take
account for the regression model is the Breusch-Godfrey test, also
referred to as the LM (Lagrange Multiplier) test for serial correlation.
It is used to test the joint hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation
in the residuals up to a certain specified order. A small p-value
indicates there is significant autocorrelation remaining in the
residuals. The Breusch-Godfrey test is similar to the Ljung-Box test,
but it is specifically designed for use with regression models.

More often than not, time series data are ``non-stationary''; that is,
the values of the time series do not fluctuate around a constant mean or
with a constant variance.

There are several useful predictors that occur frequently when using
regression for time series data:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  A trend variable can be specified in the tslm() function using the
  trend predictor.
\item
  dummy variables for time like day of week. The tslm() function will
  automatically handle this situation if you specify the predictor
  season.
\end{itemize}

trend and season are not objects in the R workspace; they are created
automatically by tslm() when specified in this way: tslm(beer2
\textasciitilde{} trend + season)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  interventions, eg. competitor activity
\item
  trading days: bizdays()
\item
  distirbuted lags
\item
  easter()
\item
  An alternative to using seasonal dummy variables, especially for long
  seasonal periods, is to use Fourier terms. ith Fourier terms, we often
  need fewer predictors than with dummy variables, especially when m is
  large. This makes them useful for weekly data, for example, where m ≈
  52. For short seasonal periods (e.g., quarterly data), there is little
  advantage in using Fourier terms over seasonal dummy variables.
  fourier() - tslm(beer2 \textasciitilde{} trend + fourier(beer2, K=2))
\end{itemize}

A regression model containing Fourier terms is often called a harmonic
regression because the successive Fourier terms represent harmonics of
the first two Fourier terms.

leave-one-out cross-validation statistic : CV(fit.consMR) for model
selection

we recommend that one of the AICc, AIC, or CV statistics be used, each
of which has forecasting as their objective.

Ex-ante forecasts are those that are made using only the information
that is available in advance. Ex-post forecasts are those that are made
using later information on the predictors. These are not genuine
forecasts, but are useful for studying the behavior of forecasting
models.

Use lagged values of predictors

A log-log functional form is specified as log(y) = beta\_0 +
beta\_1*log(x) + epsilon

In this model, the slope can be interpreted as an elasticity, and is the
average percentage change in y resulting from a 1\% increase in x. Other
useful forms can also be specified. The log-linear form is specified by
only transforming the forecast variable and the linear-log form is
obtained by transforming the predictor.

It is not recommended that quadratic or higher order trends be used in
forecasting. When they are extrapolated, the resulting forecasts are
often unrealistic.

fit.exp \textless{}- tslm(marathon \textasciitilde{} trend, lambda = 0)

splinef(lambda=0)

A log transformation can address heteroskedasticity.

\subsection{C6}\label{c6}

Thus we think of a time series as comprising three components: a
trend-cycle component, a seasonal component, and a remainder component
(containing anything else in the time series).

y = s + t + r or y = str. s is seasonal, t is tend, r is the remainder

The additive decomposition is the most appropriate if the magnitude of
the seasonal fluctuations, or the variation around the trend-cycle, does
not vary with the level of the time series. When the variation in the
seasonal pattern, or the variation around the trend-cycle, appears to be
proportional to the level of the time series, then a multiplicative
decomposition is more appropriate. Multiplicative decompositions are
common with economic time series.

An alternative to using a multiplicative decomposition is to first
transform the data until the variation in the series appears to be
stable over time, then use an additive decomposition. When a log
transformation has been used, this is equivalent to using a
multiplicative decomposition

Remove seasonality to make data seasonally adjusted. Remove when not
needed.

simple moving average of order m: ma(elecsales, 5). m is usually odd so
the sma is symmetric. It is possible to apply a moving average to a
moving average. One reason for doing this is to make an even-order
moving average symmetric. The notation ``2x4-MA'' in the last column
means a 4-MA followed by a 2-MA. Called a centered MA of order 4.

The most common use of centered moving averages is for estimating the
trend-cycle from seasonal data.

In general, a 2xm-MA is equivalent to a weighted moving average of order
m+1 where all observations take the weight 1/m except for the first and
last terms which take weights 1/2m.

additive/multiplicative decomposition
(decompose(type=``multiplicative'')) not used now because there are
better methods.

Another popular method for decomposing quarterly and monthly data is the
X11 method: seasonal::seas(x11 = ''). from this output seasonal() will
extract the seasonal component, trendcycle() will extract the
trend-cycle component, remainder() will extract the remainder component,
and seasadj() will compute the seasonally adjusted time series.

SEATS: seasonal::seas()

STL: best so far but only uses additive decomposition. stl(t.window=13,
s.window=``periodic'', robust=TRUE). automate picking of first 2 params
with mstl()

A time series decomposition can be used to measure the strength of trend
and seasonality in a time series. A series with seasonal strength close
to 0 exhibits almost no seasonality, while a series with strong
seasonality will have close to 1

While decomposition is primarily useful for studying time series data,
and exploring historical changes over time, it can also be used in
forecasting.

To forecast a decomposed time series, we forecast the seasonal component
and the seasonally adjusted component separately. It is usually assumed
that the seasonal component is unchanging, or changing extremely slowly,
so it is forecast by simply taking the last year of the estimated
component. In other words, a seasonal naïve method is used for the
seasonal component.

To forecast the seasonally adjusted component, any non-seasonal
forecasting method may be used. For example, a random walk with drift
model, or Holt's method (discussed in the next chapter), or a
non-seasonal ARIMA model.

A short-cut approach is to use the stlf() function. The following code
will decompose the time series using STL, forecast the seasonally
adjusted series, and return reseasonalize the forecasts: stlf(elecequip,
method=`naive')

\subsection{C7}\label{c7}

simple exponential smoothing: For example, it may be sensible to attach
larger weights to more recent observations than to observations from the
distant past. This is exactly the concept behind simple exponential
smoothing. It has the weighted average form, component form,

exponential smoothing has a ``flat'' forecast function. That is, all
forecasts take the same value, equal to the last level component.
Remember that these forecasts will only be suitable if the time series
has no trend or seasonal component.

The application of every exponential smoothing method requires the
smoothing parameters and the initial values to be chosen. THis is a
nonlinear optimization.

holt linear trend: holt(). Damped Holt's method is best whether you
compare MAE or MSE values. So we will proceed with using the damped
Holt's method and apply it to the whole data set to get forecasts for
future years.

holt-winters seasonal method: hw(aust,seasonal=``additive'')

A method that often provides accurate and robust forecasts for seasonal
data is the Holt-Winters method with a damped trend and multiplicative
seasonality: hw(y, damped=TRUE, seasonal=``multiplicative'')

Each method is labelled by a pair of letters (T,S) defining the type of
`Trend' and `Seasonal' components. For example, (A,M) is the method with
an additive trend and multiplicative seasonality; (A\_d, N) is the
method with damped trend and no seasonality, and so on.

Each model consists of a measurement equation that describes the
observed data, and some state equations that describe how the unobserved
components or states (level, trend, seasonal) change over time. Hence,
these are referred to as state space models. For each method there exist
two models: one with additive errors and one with multiplicative errors.
The point forecasts produced by the models are identical if they use the
same smoothing parameter values. They will, however, generate different
prediction intervals.

To distinguish between a model with additive errors and one with
multiplicative errors (and also to distinguish the models from the
methods), we add a third letter to the classification of the table
above. We label each state space model as ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonal).
This label can also be thought of as ExponenTial Smoothing. The
possibilities for each component are: Error = \{a.m\}, Trend =
\{n,a,a\_d\}, and Seasonal = \{n,a,m\}.

ETS(A,N,N): simple exponential smoothing with additive errors

ETS(M,N,N): simple exponential smoothing with multiplicative errors

ETS(A,A,N): Holt's linear method with additive errors

ETS(M,A,N): Holt's linear method with multiplicative errors

An alternative to estimating the parameters by minimizing the sum of
squared errors is to maximize the ``likelihood''. The likelihood is the
probability of the data arising from the specified model. Thus, a large
likelihood is associated with a good model. For an additive error model,
maximizing the likelihood gives the same results as minimizing the sum
of squared errors. However, different results will be obtained for
multiplicative error models.

Model Selection: A great advantage of the ETS statistical framework is
that information criteria can be used for model selection - AIC, AIC\_c,
and BIC

Three of the combinations of (Error, Trend, Seasonal) can lead to
numerical difficulties. Specifically, the models that can cause such
instabilities are ETS(A,N,M), ETS(A,A,M), and ETS(A,A d ,M), due to
division by values potentially close to zero in the state equations. We
normally do not consider these particular combinations when selecting a
model.

Models with multiplicative errors are useful when the data are strictly
positive, but are not numerically stable when the data contain zeros or
negative values. Therefore, multiplicative error models will not be
considered if the time series is not strictly positive. In that case,
only the six fully additive models will be applied.

The ets() function does not produce forecasts. Rather, it estimates the
model parameters and returns information about the fitted model. By
default it uses the AICc to select an appropriate model

ets(y, model=``ZZZ'', damped=NULL, alpha=NULL, beta=NULL, gamma=NULL,
phi=NULL, lambda=NULL, biasadj=FALSE, additive.only=FALSE,
restrict=TRUE, allow.multiplicative.trend=FALSE)

Point forecasts are obtained from the models by iterating the equations
for t = T+1 -\textgreater{} T + h and setting all e\_t = 0 for t
\textgreater{} T. These forecasts are identical to the forecasts from
Holt's linear method, and also to those from model ETS(A,A,N). Thus, the
point forecasts obtained from the method and from the two models that
underlie the method are identical (assuming that the same parameter
values are used).

ETS point forecasts are equal to the medians of the forecast
distributions. For models with only additive components, the forecast
distributions are normal, so the medians and means are equal. For ETS
models with multiplicative errors, or with multiplicative seasonality,
the point forecasts will not be equal to the means of the forecast
distributions.

\subsection{C8: arima}\label{c8-arima}

Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are the two most widely used
approaches to time series forecasting, and provide complementary
approaches to the problem. While exponential smoothing models are based
on a description of the trend and seasonality in the data, ARIMA models
aim to describe the autocorrelations in the data.

A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the
time at which the series is observed.14 Thus, time series with trends,
or with seasonality, are not stationary --- the trend and seasonality
will affect the value of the time series at different times. On the
other hand, a white noise series is stationary --- it does not matter
when you observe it, it should look much the same at any point in time.

Some cases can be confusing --- a time series with cyclic behaviour (but
with no trend or seasonality) is stationary. This is because the cycles
are not of a fixed length, so before we observe the series we cannot be
sure where the peaks and troughs of the cycles will be.

In general, a stationary time series will have no predictable patterns
in the long-term. Time plots will show the series to be roughly
horizontal (although some cyclic behavior is possible), with constant
variance.

note that the Google stock price was non-stationary in panel (a), but
the daily changes were stationary in panel (b). This shows one way to
make a non-stationary time series stationary --- compute the differences
between consecutive observations. This is known as differencing.

The ACF of the differenced Google stock price looks just like that of a
white noise series. There are no autocorrelations lying outside the 95\%
limits, and the Ljung-Box statistic has a p-value of 0.355 (for h=10 ).
This suggests that the daily change in the Google stock price is
essentially a random amount which is uncorrelated with that of previous
days.

The differenced series is the change between consecutive observations in
the original series, and can be written as: y\_t* = y\_t - y\_\{t-1\}

When the differenced series is white noise, the model for the original
series can be written as y\_t - y\_\{t-1\} = e\_t (white noise)

Random walk models are widely used for non-stationary data, particularly
financial and economic data. Random walks typically have: long periods
of apparent trends up or down, sudden and unpredictable changes in
direction.

In practice, it is almost never necessary to go beyond second-order
differences.

A seasonal difference is the difference between an observation and the
previous observation from the same season.

If seasonally differenced data appear to be white noise, then an
appropriate model for the original data is y\_t = y\_\{t-m\} + e\_t.
Forecasts from this model are equal to the last observation from the
relevant season. That is, this model gives seasonal naïve forecasts.

Sometimes it is necessary to take both a seasonal difference and a first
difference to obtain stationary data

When both seasonal and first differences are applied, it makes no
difference which is done first---the result will be the same. However,
if the data have a strong seasonal pattern, we recommend that seasonal
differencing be done first, because the resulting series will sometimes
be stationary and there will be no need for a further first difference.
If first differencing is done first, there will still be seasonality
present.

One way to determine more objectively whether differencing is required
is to use a unit root test. These are statistical hypothesis tests of
stationarity that are designed for determining whether differencing is
required.

A number of unit root tests are available, which are based on different
assumptions and may lead to conflicting answers. In our analysis, we use
the Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test. In this test, the
null hypothesis is that the data are stationary, and we look for
evidence that the null hypothesis is false. Consequently, small p-values
(e.g., less than 0.05) suggest that differencing is required. The test
can be computed using the ur.kpss() function from the urca package.

This process of using a sequence of KPSS tests to determine the
appropriate number of first differences is carried out by the function
ndiffs()

A similar function for determining whether seasonal differencing is
required is nsdiffs(), which uses the measure of seasonal strength

The backward shift operator B is a useful notational device when working
with time series lags. The backward shift operator is convenient for
describing the process of differencing. A first difference can be
written as:

y\_t' = y\_t - y\_\{t-\} = y\_t -by\_t = (1-b) y\_t

In general, a d th-order difference can be written as: (y\_t)\^{}d =
(1-b)\^{}d y\_t

In a multiple regression model, we forecast the variable of interest
using a linear combination of predictors. In an auto-regression model,
we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of past
values of the variable. We refer to this as an AR(p) model, an
autoregressive model of order p.

for ar(1) model, y\_t is white noise when beta\_1 is 0, a random walk
when beta\_1 is 1 and beta\_0 is 0, a random walk with drift when
beta\_1 is 1 and beta\_0 is not zero, and y\_t oscillates if beta\_1 is
negative.

We normally restrict autoregressive models to stationary data, in which
case some constraints on the values of the parameters are required.

Rather than using past values of the forecast variable in a regression,
a moving average model uses past forecast errors in a regression-like
model. We refer to this as an MA(q) model, a moving average model of
order q.

If we combine differencing with autoregression and a moving average
model, we obtain a non-seasonal ARIMA model. ARIMA is an acronym for
AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average

The ``predictors'' include both lagged values of y\_t and lagged errors.
We call this an ARIMA(p,d,q) model, where p is the order of the
autoregressive part; d is the degree of first differencing involved, and
q is the orer of the moving average part.

The same stationarity and invertibility conditions that are used for
autoregressive and moving average models also apply to an ARIMA model.

White noise: ARIMA(0,0,0) Random walk: ARIMA(0,1,0) with no constant
Random walk with drift: ARIMA(0,1,0) with a constant Autoregression:
ARIMA(p,0,0) Moving average: ARIMA(0,0,q)

auto.arima() does an auto fit.

The constant c has an important effect on the long-term forecasts
obtained from these models.

If c=0 and d=0, the long-term forecasts will go to zero. If c=0 and d=1,
the long-term forecasts will go to a non-zero constant. If c=0 and d=2,
the long-term forecasts will follow a straight line. If c≠0 and d=0, the
long-term forecasts will go to the mean of the data. If c≠0 and d=1, the
long-term forecasts will follow a straight line. If c≠0 and d=2, the
long-term forecasts will follow a quadratic trend.

The value of d also has an effect on the prediction intervals --- the
higher the value of d, the more rapidly the prediction intervals
increase in size. For\\
d=0, the long-term forecast standard deviation will go to the standard
deviation of the historical data, so the prediction intervals will all
be essentially the same.

partial autocorrelations. These measure the relationship between y\_t
and y\_\{t-k\} after removing the effects of lags 1,2,3,\ldots{}

It is sometimes possible to use the ACF plot, and the closely related
PACF plot, to determine appropriate values for p \& q.

ggAcf() \textbar{} ggPacf()

If the data are from an ARIMA(p,d,0) or ARIMA(0,d,q) model, then the ACF
and PACF plots can be helpful in determining the value of p/q. If p and
q are both positive, then the plots do not help in finding suitable
values of p and q.

The data may follow an ARIMA(p,d,0) model if the ACF and PACF plots of
the differenced data show the following patterns:

the ACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal; there is a significant
spike at lag\\
p in the PACF, but none beyond lag p.

The data may follow an ARIMA(0,d,q) model if the ACF and PACF plots of
the differenced data show the following patterns:

the PACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal; there is a significant
spike at lag\\
q in the ACF, but none beyond lag q.

Arima()

When fitting an ARIMA model to a set of (non-seasonal) time series data,
the following procedure provides a useful general approach.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Plot the data and identify any unusual observations.
\item
  If necessary, transform the data (using a Box-Cox transformation) to
  stabilize the variance.
\item
  If the data are non-stationary, take first differences of the data
  until the data are stationary.
\item
  Examine the ACF/PACF: Is an ARIMA(p,d,0) or ARIMA(0,d,q) model
  appropriate?
\item
  Try your chosen model(s), and use the AICc to search for a better
  model.
\item
  Check the residuals from your chosen model by plotting the ACF of the
  residuals, and doing a portmanteau test of the residuals. If they do
  not look like white noise, try a modified model.
\item
  Once the residuals look like white noise, calculate forecasts.
\end{enumerate}

auto.arima only does steps 3-5.

The inclusion of a constant in a non-stationary ARIMA model is
equivalent to inducing a polynomial trend of order d in the forecast
function.

seaosnal arima: arima(p,d,q) (P,Q,D)\_m, m = num of observations per
year

The seasonal part of an AR or MA model will be seen in the seasonal lags
of the PACF and ACF. For example, an ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,0,1)\_12 model will
show:

a spike at lag 12 in the ACF but no other significant spikes;
exponential decay in the seasonal lags of the PACF (i.e., at lags 12,
24, 36, \ldots{}).

comparing information criteria is only valid for ARIMA models of the
same orders of differencing.

\subsection{C9}\label{c9}

The time series models in the previous two chapters allow for the
inclusion of information from past observations of a series, but not for
the inclusion of other information that may also be relevant. For
example, the effects of holidays, competitor activity, changes in the
law, the wider economy, or other external variables, may explain some of
the historical variation and may lead to more accurate forecasts. On the
other hand, the regression models in Chapter 5 allow for the inclusion
of a lot of relevant information from predictor variables, but do not
allow for the subtle time series dynamics that can be handled with ARIMA
models. In this chapter, we consider how to extend ARIMA models in order
to allow other information to be included in the models.

The R function Arima() will fit a regression model with ARIMA errors if
the argument xreg is used. The order argument specifies the order of the
ARIMA error model. If differencing is specified, then the differencing
is applied to all variables in the regression model before the model is
estimated.

There are two different ways of modelling a linear trend: deterministic
and stochastic.

deterministic: fit1 \textless{}- auto.arima(austa, d=0, xreg=trend)

stochastic: fit2 \textless{}- auto.arima(austa, d=1)

There is an implicit assumption with deterministic trends that the slope
of the trend is not going to change over time. On the other hand,
stochastic trends can change, and the estimated growth is only assumed
to be the average growth over the historical period, not necessarily the
rate of growth that will be observed into the future. Consequently, it
is safer to forecast with stochastic trends, especially for longer
forecast horizons, as the prediction intervals allow for greater
uncertainty in future growth.

\textbf{9.5}

When there are long seasonal periods, a dynamic regression with Fourier
terms is often better than other models we have considered in this book.

Seasonal differencing of high order does not make a lot of sense --- for
daily data it involves comparing what happened today with what happened
exactly a year ago and there is no constraint that the seasonal pattern
is smooth.

So for such time series, we prefer a harmonic regression approach where
the seasonal pattern is modelled using Fourier terms with short-term
time series dynamics handled by an ARMA error.

So far, we have considered relatively simple seasonal patterns such as
quarterly and monthly data. However, higher frequency time series often
exhibit more complicated seasonal patterns. For example, daily data may
have a weekly pattern as well as an annual pattern. Hourly data usually
has three types of seasonality: a daily pattern, a weekly pattern, and
an annual pattern

The best way to deal with moving holiday effects is to use dummy
variables. However, neither STL, ETS nor TBATS models allow for
covariates. Amongst the models discussed in this book (and implemented
in the forecast package for R), the only choice is a dynamic regression
model, where the predictors include any dummy holiday effects (and
possibly also the seasonality using Fourier terms).

To impose a positivity constraint, simply work on the log scale, by
specifying the Box-Cox parameter lambda = 0.

we can transform the data using a scaled logit transform which maps
9a,b) to the whole real line: y = log((x-a)/(b-x))

Most time series models do not work well for very long time series. The
problem is that real data do not come from the models we use. When the
number of observations is not large (say up to about 200) the models
often work well as an approximation to whatever process generated the
data. But eventually we will have enough data that the difference
between the true process and the model starts to become more obvious. An
additional problem is that the optimization of the parameters becomes
more time consuming because of the number of observations involved.

\section{Forecasting Datacamp}\label{forecasting-datacamp}

annual data can't be seasonal. seasonal has fixed lengths, cyclical
doesn't.

When data are either seasonal or cyclic, the ACF will peak around the
seasonal lags or at the average cycle length.

white noise is iid data. 95\% of autocorrelations should be within blue
lines of acf plot.

There is a well-known result in economics called the ``Efficient Market
Hypothesis'' that states that asset prices reflect all available
information. A consequence of this is that the daily changes in stock
prices should behave like white noise (ignoring dividends, interest
rates and transaction costs). The consequence for forecasters is that
the best forecast of the future price is the current price.

diff() for daily changes

Time series forecasting is typically discussed where only a one-step
prediction is required.

What about when you need to predict multiple time steps into the future?

Predicting multiple time steps into the future is called multi-step time
series forecasting. There are four main strategies that you can use for
multi-step forecasting.

Generally, time series forecasting describes predicting the observation
at the next time step. This is called a one-step forecast, as only one
time step is to be predicted. There are some time series problems where
multiple time steps must be predicted. Contrasted to the one-step
forecast, these are called multiple-step or multi-step time series
forecasting problems.

A good model forecasts well (so has low RMSE on the test set) and uses
all available information in the training data (so has white noise
residuals).

simple exponential smoothing: large alpha puts more weight on recent
values and the weights decay quickly. ses(). Has the same value for all
forecasts.

Let's review the process:

First, import and load your data. Determine how much of your data you
want to allocate to training, and how much to testing; the sets should
not overlap.

Subset the data to create a training set, which you will use as an
argument in your forecasting function(s). Optionally, you can also
create a test set to use later.

Compute forecasts of the training set using whichever forecasting
function(s) you choose, and set h equal to the number of values you want
to forecast, which is also the length of the test set.

To view the results, use the accuracy() function with the forecast as
the first argument and original data (or test set) as the second.

Pick a measure in the output, such as RMSE or MAE, to evaluate the
forecast(s); a smaller error indicates higher accuracy.

Holt's Linear Trend: Forecasts account for trend \& continue at the same
trend indefinitely into the future: holt(damped = T) . A damped trend
makes it level off after time: holt(damped = F) (phi = 1 is Holt's
method).

Holt-Winters Method: Accounds for trend and seasonality. In the additive
version the seasonality averages to 0 but this changes to 1 in the
multiplicative version: hw(df, seasonal = `additive')

Methods with multiplicative trend produce poor forecasts.

Innovation State Space Models

trends = \{n, a, a\_d\} \{none, additive, damped\}

seasons = \{n, a, m\} \{none, additive, multiplicative\}

So there are 9 possible exponential smoothing methods. Add:

error = \{a,m\}

And there are 18 possible state space models. Known as ets models.
Estimated using likelihood. Choose model by minimizing AIC\_c (biased
correct AIC). Roughly the same as time series CV but is much faster:
ets()

transforms: square root, cube root, log, inverse (increasing strength of
transformation from left to right). Equal to lambda = 1/2, L = 1/3, L =
0, L = -1 for Box-Cox. (L=0 is no transformation.)

Not common to use box-cox with ets since ets can handle seasons \&
trends. Use box-cox with arima models when there is increasing
variation.

BoxCox.lambda()

Differencing is a way of making a time series stationary; this means
that you remove any systematic patterns such as trend and seasonality
from the data. A white noise series is considered a special case of a
stationary time series. With non-seasonal data, you use lag-1
differences to model changes between observations rather than the
observations directly. You have done this before by using the diff()
function.

With seasonal data, differences are often taken between observations in
the same season of consecutive years, rather than in consecutive
periods. For example, with quarterly data, one would take the difference
between Q1 in one year and Q1 in the previous year. This is called
seasonal differencing. Sometimes you need to apply both seasonal
differences and lag-1 differences to the same series, thus, calculating
the differences in the differences.

auto.arima()

Don't compare an arima AIC\_c with one from an ets. Comparisons only
work within models of the same type.

The Arima() function can be used to select a specific ARIMA model. Its
first argument, order, is set to a vector that specifies the values of
p, d and q. The second argument, include.constant, is a boolean that
determines if the constant c, or drift, should be included.

The AICc statistic is useful for selecting between models in the same
class. For example, you can use it to select an ETS model or to select
an ARIMA model. However, you cannot use it to compare ETS and ARIMA
models because they are in different model classes. Instead, you can use
time series cross-validation to compare an ARIMA model and an ETS model
on the austa data. Because tsCV() requires functions that return
forecast objects, you will set up some simple functions that fit the
models and return the forecasts.

What happens when you want to create training and test sets for data
that is more frequent than yearly? If needed, you can use a vector in
form c(year, period) for the start and/or end keywords in the window()
function. You must also ensure that you're using the appropriate values
of h in forecasting functions. Recall that h should be equal to the
length of the data that makes up your test

Another time series with multiple seasonal periods is calls, which
contains 20 consecutive days of 5-minute call volume data for a large
North American bank. There are 169 5-minute periods in a working day,
and so the weekly seasonal frequency is 5 x 169 = 845. The weekly
seasonality is relatively weak, so here you will just model daily
seasonality.

The residuals in this case still fail the white noise tests, but their
autocorrelations are tiny, even though they are significant. This is
because the series is so long. It is often unrealistic to have residuals
that pass the tests for such long series. The effect of the remaining
correlations on the forecasts will be negligible.

Outliers in small samples:
\url{https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/78609/outlier-detection-in-very-small-sets/78617\#78617}

Since all outcomes are 0 or 1, and drawn with the same (unknown)
probability, we know that the number of ones and zeros follows a
binomial distribution. This means that the confidence interval of a ``k
out of n'' scenario is a Beta distribution.

Another common measure of effect size is d, sometimes known as Cohen's d
(as you might have guessed by now, Cohen was quite influential in the
field of effect sizes). This can be used when comparing two means, as
when you might do a t-test, and is simply the difference in the two
groups' means divided by the average of their standard deviations*. This
means that if we see a d of 1, we know that the two groups' means differ
by one standard deviation; a d of .5 tells us that the two groups' means
differ by half a standard deviation; and so on. Cohen suggested that
d=0.2 be considered a `small' effect size, 0.5 represents a `medium'
effect size and 0.8 a `large' effect size. This means that if two
groups' means don't differ by 0.2 standard deviations or more, the
difference is trivial, even if it is statistically significant.

Beta Distribution: The larger the alpha parameter is the closer the
resulting distribution is to 1.0 and the larger the beta the closer it
is to 0.

Bayes Rule: Posterior = Likelihood * Prior / Marginal Likelihood

\url{https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/effsize/versions/0.7.1/topics/cohen.d}

Likelihood P(Data\textbar{}theta): Probability of the date could be
generated by a model with the given parameter(s)

Prior P(theta): Probability of parameter value

Posterior P(theta\textbar{}D): Credibility of the parameter value with
the data taken into account.

Marginal Likelihood (Evidence): Probability of evidence

Variance: Spread of the data \textbar{} Distance from the mean

Standard Deviation: Square root of the variance \textbar{} Same units as
the data

Mean: Average/Expected Value

Covariance: Measure of how two random values change together. Negative -
variables show opposite behavior ( As A increases B decreases). Positive
- variables show similar behavior (As A increases B increases)

Pearson Correlation: Normalized version of covariance

Median: Number at the halfway point of the dataset, found through
sorting data into ascending order and selecting middle point

Mode: Most frequent value in dataset

Note about Populations and Samples: Populations have parameters. Samples
have statistics.

Distributions:

Normal/Gaussian: Parameters are mean and standard deviation. Bell
shaped. z-score: indicates how many standard deviations an element is
from the mean

Student t: used to estimate the mean of a normally distributed
population where the sample size is small and the standard deviation is
unknown

A t test (t.test in R) is a special case of an ANOVA and a paired t test
(parameter paired = T) is a special case of a repeated measures ANOVA.

Sample size: A good formula is: if your sample is picked uniformly at
random and is of size at least:

\(\frac{-log(\frac{d}{2})}{2e^2}\)

then with probability at least 1-d your sample measured proportion q is
no further away than e from the unknown true population proportion p
(what you are trying to estimate). Need to estimate with 99\% certainty
the unknown true population rate to +- 10\% precision? That is d=0.01,
e=0.1 and a sample of size 265 should be enough. A stricter precision of
+-0.05 causes the estimated sample size to increase to 1060, but
increasing the certainty requirement to 99.5\% only increases the
estimated sample size to 300.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Type I Error: Saying there is an effect when there isn't one. Type II
  error: concluding there is no effect when, in fact, there is one.
\item
  The MWW RankSum test is a useful test to determine if two
  distributions are significantly different or not. Unlike the t-test,
  the RankSum test does not assume that the data are normally
  distributed, potentially providing a more accurate assessment of the
  data sets.
\item
  Probably the most useful types of statistics for skewed probability
  distributions are quantiles.
\item
  Hypothesis testing requires an inferential-statistical approach.
  Crucial are meaningful distributions of test statistics, on which
  p-values for hypothesis tests can be based. It is not trivial to
  construct such ``meaningful distributions'' for complete network data!

  and the known value of the population mean. Assumes the population
  from which the sample is drawn is normally distributed and the sample
  observations are randomly drawn and independent.
\item
  Two Sample T-test: To examine the average difference between two
  samples drawn from two different populations. Assumes the populations

\item
  One-Way ANOVA: To assess the equality of means of two or more groups.
  Assumes the populations from which the samples are drawn are normally

  are equal. Assumes the population from which the sample is drawn is
  normally distributed and the sample observations are randomly drawn
  and independent.
\item
  Barlett Test: F-Test for more than two populations.
\item
  If we take a larger and larger sample from a population, its
  distribution will tend to become normal no matter what it is
  initially. It won't. The Central Limit Theorem, the misreading of
  which is the cause of this mistake, refers to the distribution of

  of the populations are equal. Sample observations are randomly drawn
  and independent.
\item
  When do we use the chisq2 Test of Independence? To test whether two

\item
  To perform the one-way ANOVA, we can use the f\_oneway() function of
  the SciPy package.
\item
  The degrees of freedom is the number of data rows minus the number of

\item
  Hypothesis tests aim to describe the plausibility of a parameter
  taking on a specific value. Confidence intervals aim to describe a
  range of plausible values a parameter can take on. If the value of the
  parameter specified by H0 is contained within the 95\% confidence
  interval, then H0 cannot be rejectedat the 0.05 p-value threshold. If
  the value of the parameter specified by H0 is not contained within the
  95\% confidence interval, then H0 can be rejectedat the 0.05 p-value
  threshold.

\subsection*{Introduction to Data}\label{introduction-to-data}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Introduction to Data}

There is no random sampling since the subjects of the study were
volunteers, so the results cannot be generalized to all people. However,
due to random assignment, we are able to infer a causal link between the
belief information is stored and the ability to recall that same
information.

Explanatory variables are conditions you can impose on the experimental
units, while blocking variables are characteristics that the
experimental units come with that you would like to control for.

In random sampling, you use stratifying to control for a variable. In
random assignment, you use blocking to achieve the same goal.

Control: compare treatment of interest to a control group

Randomize: randomly assign subjects to treatments

Replicate: collect a sufficiently large sample within a study, or
replicate the entire study

Block: account for the potential effect of confounding variables

Group subjects into blocks based on these variations, and randomize
within each block to treatment groups

Random Sampling + Random Assignment: Causal + generalizable

No Random Sampling + Random Assignment: Causal + not generalizable

Random Sampling + No Random Assignment: Not causal + generalizable

No Random Sampling + No Random Assignment: Not causal + not
generalizable

\subsection{Statistical Tests}\label{statistical-tests}

The appropriate sample size depends on many things, chiefly the
complexity of the analysis and the expected effect size. The ``30'' rule
comes from one of the simplest cases: Whether to use a z-test or t-test
for comparing two means.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  for large n (sample size), many distributions can be approximated to
  normal. {[} courtesy : Central Limit Theorems {]}
\item
  The approximation becomes better with larger n, given other things
  remaining the same.
\end{enumerate}

However if you are wondering why 30 ? why not 25 or 40 or something else
? Note that actual answer will depend:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  how much error are you going to tolerate
\item
  size of the effect
\item
  exact distribution family (like t vs chi-square vs gamma)
\end{enumerate}

The power of any test of statistical significance is defined as the
probability that it will reject a false null hypothesis. Statistical
power is inversely related to beta or the probability of making a Type
II error. In short, power = 1 -- β. In plain English, statistical power
is the likelihood that a study will detect an effect when there is an
effect there to be detected. If statistical power is high, the
probability of making a Type II error, or concluding there is no effect
when, in fact, there is one, goes down. Statistical power is affected
chiefly by the size of the effect and the size of the sample used to
detect it. Bigger effects are easier to detect than smaller effects,
while large samples offer greater test sensitivity than small samples.

The following four quantities have an intimate relationship:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  sample size
\item
  effect size
\item
  significance level = P(Type I error) = probability of finding an
  effect that is not there
\item
  power = 1 - P(Type II error) = probability of finding an effect that
  is there
\end{itemize}

Given any three, we can determine the fourth.

\textbf{Other}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The power of any test of statistical significance is defined as the
  probability that it will reject a false null hypothesis. Statistical
  power is inversely related to beta or the probability of making a Type
  II error. In short, power = 1 -- beta.
\item
  For quantitative explanatory variables, effect sizes always have the
  unit of the response variable divided by the unit of the explanatory
  variable.

\subsection{Stats For Hackers}\label{stats-for-hackers}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Methods: Simluation, Boostrapping (with replacement, not good with
  ranks), Shuffling (Works when assumption is that the data are the
  same, representative samples, non-longitudinal data), \& Cross
  Validation.
\item
  Assumes iid.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Think Stats}\label{think-stats}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Is it possible that the apparent effect is due to selection bias or
  some other error in the experimental setup? If so, then we might
  conclude that the effect is an artifact; that is, something we created
  (by accident) rather than found.
\item
  The sampling distribution is the distribution of the samples mean.
\item
  The CDF is the function that maps values to their percentile rank in a
  distribution.
\item
  I'll start with the exponential distribution because it is easy to
  work with. In the real world, exponential distributions come up when
  we look at a series of events and measure the times between events,
  which are called interarrival times. If the events are equally likely
  to occur at any time, the distribution of inter-arrival times tends to
  look like an exponential distribution.
\item
  CLT: More specifically, if the distribution of the values has mean and
  standard deviation μ and σ, the distribution of the sum is
  approximately N (nμ, nσ\^{}2).
\item
  Another option is to report just the Bayes Factor or likelihood ratio,
  P(E \textbar{} H A ) / P(E\textbar{}H 0 ), rather than the posterior
  probability.
\item
  Statistical power is the probability that the test will be positive if
  the null hypothesis is false. In general, the power of a test depends
  on the sample size, the magnitude of the effect, and the threshold α.
\item
  If there are no outliers, the sample mean minimizes the mean squared
  error
\item
  An estimator is unbiased if the expected total (or mean) error, after
  many iterations of the estimation game, is 0.
\item
  A challenge in measuring correlation is that the variables we want to
  compare might not be expressed in the same units. For example, height
  might be in centimeters and weight in kilograms. And even if they are
  in the same units, they come from different distributions. There are
  two common solutions to these problems:
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Transform all values to standard scores. This leads to the Pearson
  coefficient of correlation.
\item
  Transform all values to their percentile ranks. This leads to the
  Spearman coefficient.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Policy \& Ethics}

In the study, what risk is the participant undertaking? The main
threshold is whether the risk exceeds that of ``minimal risk''.

Next, what benefits might result from the study? Even if the risk is
minimal, how might the results help?

Third, what other choices do participants have? For example, if you are
testing out changes to a search engine, participants always have the
choice to use another search engine.

Finally, what data is being collected, and what is the expectation of
privacy and confidentiality? This last question is quite nuanced,
encompassing numerous questions: Do participants understand what data is
being collected about them? What harm would befall them should that data
be made public? Would they expect that data to be considered private and
confidential?

Our recommendation is that there should be internal reviews of all
proposed studies by experts regarding the questions:

Are participants facing more than minimal risk? Do participants
understand what data is being gathered? Is that data identifiable? How
is the data handled?

Internal process recommendations Finally, regarding internal process of
data handling, we recommend that:

Every employee who might be involved in A/B test be educated about the
ethics and the protection of the participants. Clearly there are other
areas of ethics beyond what we've covered that discuss integrity,
competence, and responsibility, but those generally are broader than
protecting participants of A/B tests (cite ACM code of ethics).

All data, identified or not, be stored securely, with access limited to
those who need it to complete their job. Access should be time limited.
There should be clear policies of what data usages are acceptable and
not acceptable. Moreover, all usage of the data should be logged and
audited regularly for violations. You create a clear escalation path for
how to handle cases where there is even possibly more than minimal risk
or data sensitivity issues.

\textbf{Choosing \& Characterizing Metrics}

\textbf{Define}

Make sure to granularize funnel

\textbf{Intuition}

NA

\textbf{Characterize}

Focus groups, UER (user experience study), survey, experiments,
retrospective analysis, external data

temporal effects across hours, days, weeks are important

different browsers screw with the CTR depending on how they deal with JS

Can use cookies to track users

Metric definitions

Def \#1 (Cookie probability): For each , number of cookies that click
divided by number of cookies

Def \#2 (Pageview probability): Number of pageviews with a click within
divided by number of pageviews

Def \#3 (Rate): Number of clicks divided by number of pageviews

CTR vs CTP: The first can be \textgreater{}1.

Take into consideration mean and median. Median is robust but might not
be useful so look at percentiles.

Measuring sensitiviyt and robustness: 1) Running experiments to see if
metrics move as predicted. A vs A experiments: Measure people who saw
the same thing to see if there is a difference between them according to
the metric or its too sensitive. Look at previous experiments. 2)
Retrospective analysis of logs to see how the metrics responded in the
past.

Metric For Loading Vid: Look at distribution of load times for vid. Want
a robust metric that doesn't really change for comparable vids. But wnat
a metric that is sensitive to a change that you care about like
resolution.

How to compare experiment vs control: difference or relative change.
Relative change allows you to keep same significance boundary.

Check that praticial sig level is good for metric. Need to have handle
on variability for confidence interval.

sign test: Good for looking to implement a change, but doesn't give
effect size.

empirical vs analytic: underlying distribution could be weird so do
empirical. Analyticcal for simple metrics. If empirical and anlytical
don't agree then run AvA test.

A vs A test: Std proportional to square root of number of samples.
Diminishing returns for many tests. Can use bootstrap if don't have
enough traffic for a big A v A test.

\textbf{Designing An Experiment}

\textbf{Choose Subject}

Unit of Diversion: How to indentify a person. Cookie (could clear so
change), userid, deviceid, and address (changes all the time).

Intra-user vs inter-user experiment.

\textbf{Choose Population}

Size

Duration

Cohort: People who enter the experiment at the same time.

Cohort \textgreater{} Population: Learning effects, user retention

Can reduce sample if just targeting english speaking traffic

When going to run experiment: holiday or not? How many people to put
through experiment and control?

\textbf{Analyzing Results}

Sanity Checks:

Pass all before move on

Good invariants: \# of events, video load time (user has no control over
it). Want these to be about the same for experiment and control.

Single Metric:

sign test

Multiple Metrics:

More metrics increase false positive chance. Use Bonferroni assumption:
makes no independence assumption and is conservative.

margin of error smaller than observed diff so the confidence interval
won't include 0.

Different strategies: family-wise error rate, false discovery rate,

Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) experiment

Power usually @ 80\%. power effect size \& sample size all inter-related
(with 2 can calculate 3rd).

power: prob that test correctly rejects null hypo when alt hypo is true

effect size: standardized measure of the difference you're trying to
detect

sample size: how many experimental units needed to survey to detect the
desired diff at the desired power

pwr::pwr.anova.test() {[}exactly one of n, d, power, and sig.level must
be NULL{]}

aov = lm + anova aov + tukey hsd

Another assumption of ANOVA and linear modeling is homogeneity of
variance. Homogeneity means ``same'', and here that would mean that the
variance of int\_rate is the same for each level of grade. We can test
for homogeneity of variances using bartlett.test(), which takes a
formula and a dataset as inputs.

One non-parametric alternative to ANOVA is the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum
test. For those with some statistics knowledge, it is an extension of
the Mann-Whitney U test for when there are more than two groups, such as
with our grade variable.

Use the correct function from pwr to find the sample size (d is the
effect size) pwr::pwr.t.test(n = NULL, d = .2, power = .8, sig.level
=.05, alternative = ``two.sided'')

multivariable experiment:

lendingclub\_multi \textless{}- lm(loan\_amnt \textasciitilde{} Group +
grade + verification\_status, lendingclub\_ab) tidy(lendingclub\_multi)

The sampling package's cluster() creates cluster samples. It takes in a
dataset name, the variable in the set to be used as the cluster
variable, passed as a vector with the name as a string,
e.g.~c(``variable''), a number of clusters to select, and a method

Randomized Complete Block Designs

the purpose of blocking an experiment is to make the experimental groups
more like one another.

A rule of thumb in experimental design is often ``block what you can,
randomize what you cannot'', which means you should aim to block the
effects you can control for (e.g.~sex) randomize on those you cannot
(e.g.~smoking status). Variability inside a block is expected to be
fairly small, but variability between blocks will be larger.

  By reducing learning rate (for example, to 0.001), Test loss drops to
  a value much closer to Training loss. In most runs, increasing Batch

  Always try to lower your learning rate for improvement.
\item
  ADAGRAD is another optimization option that takes care of some of the
  hyperparameters for you.
\item
  n inputs and k outputs gives you \((n+1)*k\) parameters.
\item
  Back propogation takes about twice the memory as forward propogation.
\item
  Stop model from overoptimizing on training set: early termination
  (stop as soon as performance on validation set drops) and
  regularization which applies artifical constraints to reduce the
  number of free parameters while making it difficult to optimize. Uses
  l2 regularization or dropout. Dropout works by randomly setting
  activations from one layer to the next to 0 repeatly. Forces the
  network to learn redundant representations, and takes average
  consensus for final prediction. Makes things more robust and prevents
  overfitting. Scale the non-zero activates by 2 to get the right
  average. If it doesn't work, go deeper.
\item
  Two ways are to average the yellow, blue, and green channels or to use
  YUV representation. If position on the screen doesn't matter then use
  translation invariance. Use weight sharing if this occurs in text.
\item
  Things that don't chnage across time, space, etc are called
  statistical invariants.
\item
  RNN's use shared parameters over time to extract patterns. Uses a
  recurrent connection to provide a summary of the past and pass this
  info to the classifier.
\item
  Backpropagation occurs throw time to the beginning. All derivative
  applied to same parameters, so very correlated. Bad for stochastic
  gradient descent and makes math very unstable. Gradients are either
  zero (doesn't remember the past well) or infinity. The latter is fixed
  by gradient clipping and the former by LSTM (long-short term memory).
  LSTM replaced the rectified linear units by continuous functions. You
  can use dropout or L2 regularization with an LSTM.
\item
  Generally dealing with images, Convolutional Neural Network is used

\item
  BackProp Algorithm: Initially all the edge weights are randomly
  assigned. For every input in the training dataset, the ANN is
  activated and its output is observed. This output is compared with the
  desired output that we already know, and the error is ``propagated''
  back to the previous layer. This error is noted and the weights are
  ``adjusted'' accordingly. This process is repeated until the output
  error is below a predetermined threshold.
\item
  The last layer of a neural network captures the most complex

\item
  This is exactly what's happening in the vanishing gradient problem --
  the gradients of the network's output with respect to the parameters

\section{LSTMs}\label{lstms}

Long Short Term Memory networks -- usually just called ``LSTMs'' -- are
a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. LSTMs
are essentially the same thing as the RNN we will develop in this
tutorial, they just have a different way of computing the hidden state.

The default activation function for LSTMs is the hyperbolic tangent
(tanh), which outputs values between -1 and 1. This is the preferred
range for the time series data: MinMaxScaler(feature\_range=(-1, 1)).

Keras LSTM expects the input as well as the target data to be in a
specific shape. The input has to be a 3-d array of size num\_samples,
num\_timesteps, num\_features.

The way we can do this, with Keras, is by wiring the LSTM hidden states
to sets of consecutive outputs of the same length. Thus, if we want to
produce predictions for 12 months, our LSTM should have a hidden state
length of 12.

Keras - stateful vs stateless LSTMs

One major issue with layer\_simple\_rnn is that although it should
theoretically be able to retain at time t information about inputs seen
many time steps before, in practice, such long-term dependencies are
impossible to learn. This is due to the vanishing gradient problem, an
effect that is similar to what is observed with non-recurrent networks
(feed forward networks) that are many layers deep: as you keep adding
layers to a network, the network eventually becomes un-trainable.

A loss function is used to optimize a machine learning algorithm. An
accuracy metric is used to measure the algorithm's performance
(accuracy) in an interpretable way.

\section{DL.AI: Intro}\label{dl.ai-intro}

ng thinks dl easier of matrix is n x m instead of m x n so target is a
row vector instead of a column vector

Loss function applies to a single training example while the cost
function applies to many. The loss function computes the error for a
single training example; the cost function is the average of the loss
functions of the entire training set.

A trick when you want to flatten a matrix X of shape (a,b,c,d) to a
matrix X\_flatten of shape (b ∗∗ c ∗∗ d, a) is to use:

X\_flatten = X.reshape(X.shape{[}0{]}, -1).T

One common preprocessing step in machine learning is to center and
standardize your dataset, meaning that you substract the mean of the
whole numpy array from each example, and then divide each example by the
standard deviation of the whole numpy array. But for picture datasets,
it is simpler and more convenient and works almost as well to just
divide every row of the dataset by 255 (the maximum value of a pixel
channel).

Scale images: train\_set\_x = train\_set\_x\_flatten/255.

Common steps for pre-processing a new dataset are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Figure out the dimensions and shapes of the problem (m\_train,
  m\_test, num\_px, \ldots{})
\item
  Reshape the datasets such that each example is now a vector of size
  (num\_px * num\_px * 3, 1)
\item
  ``Standardize'' the data
\end{itemize}

Preprocessing the dataset is important.

You implemented each function separately: initialize(), propagate(),
optimize(). Then you built a model().

Tuning the learning rate (which is an example of a ``hyperparameter'')
can make a big difference to the algorithm. You will see more examples
of this later in this course!

The tanh activation usually works better than sigmoid activation
function for hidden units because the mean of its output is closer to
zero, and so it centers the data better for the next layer.

Initialize weights randomly but set bias to zero.

You have built a network using the tanh activation for all the hidden
units. You initialize the weights to relative large values, using
np.random.randn(..,..)*1000. What will happen? This will cause the
inputs of the tanh to also be very large, thus causing gradients to be
close to zero. The optimization algorithm will thus become slow.

a4\href{12}{2}: 4th neuron of the 2nd layer for the 12th training
example.

No. Sigmoid outputs a value between 0 and 1 which makes it a very good
choice for binary classification. You can classify as 0 if the output is
less than 0.5 and classify as 1 if the output is more than 0.5. It can
be done with tanh as well but it is less convenient as the output is
between -1 and 1.

random initialization of weights for logreg

What is the ``cache'' used for in our implementation of forward
propagation and backward propagation? We use it to pass variables
computed during forward propagation to the corresponding backward
propagation step. It contains useful values for backward propagation to
compute derivatives.

The deeper layers of a neural network are typically computing more
complex features of the input than the earlier layers.

During backpropagation, the corresponding backward function also needs
to know what is the activation function for layer l, since the gradient
depends on it.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{(\roman{enumi})}
\tightlist
\item
  To compute the function using a shallow network circuit, you will need
  a large network (where we measure size by the number of logic gates in
  the network), but (ii) To compute it using a deep network circuit, you
  need only an exponentially smaller network.
\end{enumerate}

gradient checking

vanishing/exploding gradients

data augmentation for images: rotate and crop

ng doesn't like dropout bc it couples optimization with regularization

early stopping

dropout is a regularization technique to prevent over-fitting.

\section{DL.AI: Improving Deep Neural
Network}\label{dl.ai-improving-deep-neural-network}

If you have 10,000,000 examples, how would you split the train/dev/test
set? 98\% train . 1\% dev . 1\% test

The dev and test set should: Come from the same distribution

If your Neural Network model seems to have high variance, what of the
following would be promising things to try? Add regularization \& Get
more training data. For high bias, make a bigger and deeper network.

What is weight decay? A regularization technique (such as L2
regularization) that results in gradient descent shrinking the weights
on every iteration. As a rule of thumb, the more training examples you
have, the weaker this term should be. The more parameters you have the
higher this term should be.

With the inverted dropout technique, at test time: You do not apply
dropout (do not randomly eliminate units) and do not keep the
1/keep\_prob factor in the calculations used in training.

With the inverted dropout technique, at test time: You do not apply
dropout (do not randomly eliminate units) and do not keep the
1/keep\_prob factor in the calculations used in training

Increasing the parameter keep\_prob from (say) 0.5 to 0.6 will likely
cause the following: Reducing the regularization effect \& Causing the
neural network to end up with a lower training set error

Normalization makes the cost function faster to optimize

Which of these techniques are useful for reducing variance (reducing
overfitting)? Dropout, L2 regularization Data augmentation

Different initializations lead to different results

Random initialization is used to break symmetry and make sure different
hidden units can learn different things

Don't intialize to values that are too large

He initialization works well for networks with ReLU activations.

\textbf{Fast.AI}

Do a loss vs learning rate plot to pick a good one. It's the key thing
to set.

learning rate annealing: decrease learning rate as you reach the
minimum.

If you try training for more epochs, you'll notice that we start to
overfit, which means that our model is learning to recognize the
specific images in the training set, rather than generalizing such that
we also get good results on the validation set. One way to fix this is
to effectively create more data, through data augmentation. This refers
to randomly changing the images in ways that shouldn't impact their
interpretation, such as horizontal flipping, zooming, and rotating.

mse: loss function for regression

Cross-entropy: loss function for classification

Gradient descent: a generic method that can optimize any differentiable
loss function

Analtycial soltion for linear modela nd MSE effectivr when: Small number
of features

There is an analytical solution for linear regression parameters and MSE
loss, but we usually prefer gradient descent optimization over it. What
are the reasons?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Gradient descent doesn't require to invert a matrix
\item
  Gradient descent is more scalable and can be applied for problems with
  high number of features
\end{itemize}

Number of params in logistic regression: k*d where k is the number of
classes and d is the size of the dimensional space.

Large model weights can indicate that model is overfitted

Weight penalty drives model parameters closer to zero and prevents the
model from being too sensitive to small changes in features

disadvantages do model validation on holdout sample can give biased
quality estimates for small samples

Stochastic gradient descent: Noisy but evntually converge to minimum.
Needs only one example at each step. Can be used online. Choose the
learning rate carefully.

mini-batch gradient descent

Gradient descent extensions: adagrad, rms prop,adam

The best nonlinearity functions to use in a Multilayer perceptron are
step functions as they allow to reconstruct the decision boundary with
better precision? No. Step function gradient with the respect to its
input is zero almost everywhere - thus the resulting network can't be
trained via backpropagation.

A dense layer applies a linear transformation to its input

For an MLP to work, the nonlinearity function must have a finite upper
bound? No, widely used ReLu has no upper bound.

How many dimensions will a derivative of a 1-D vector by a 2-D matrix
have? 3. The rule of thumb is that the final derivative will consist of
derivatives of each component of the output by each component of input.
So, for each element of the output vector there will be a 2-D matrix of
derivatives, 3 dimensions in total.

Sigmoid neurons can lead to vanshing gradients at its extremes. ReLU
better. Leaky ReLU best to avoid non-activation.

Dropout is a regularization technique.

Convulations and pooling layes are invariant to translation of images.

We have reviewed the activation function, weights initializations, and a
bunch of new techniques that help to train better networks. What are the
takeaways? First, always use ReLU activation because it doesn't saturate
and it converges faster. Use He et al initialization which is square
root of two divided by square root of number of inputs. Try to add bash
normalization or dropout, maybe it will converge better. Try to augment
your training data.

Transfer learning

You should use dropout (randomly eliminate nodes) only in training.

Apply dropout both during forward and backward propagation.

During training time, divide each dropout layer by keep\_prob to keep
the same expected value for the activations. For example, if keep\_prob
is 0.5, then we will on average shut down half the nodes, so the output
will be scaled by 0.5 since only the remaining half are contributing to
the solution. Dividing by 0.5 is equivalent to multiplying by 2. Hence,
the output now has the same expected value. You can check that this
works even when keep\_prob is other values than 0.5.

inverted dropout

Gradient checking verifies closeness between the gradients from
backpropagation and the numerical approximation of the gradient
(computed using forward propagation).

Gradient checking is slow, so we don't run it in every iteration of
training. You would usually run it only to make sure your code is
correct, then turn it off and use backprop for the actual learning
process.

\subsection{Optimization Algorithms}\label{optimization-algorithms}

In batch GD the cost should be monotone decreasing. In mini-batch it
doesn't have to be since it's like training on a different training set
every time. It should still be trending downwards.

For small training set use ( \textless{} 2000) use batch GD. Use batches
of 64, 128, 256, 512 otherwise which should speed up training. Make sure
it fits in meemory. MIni-batch size is another hyperparameter.

RMS PRop

ADAM: Adam combines the advantages of RMSProp and momentum, We usually
use ``default'' values for the hyperparameters, The learning rate
hyperparameter α in Adam usually needs to be tuned.

Learning rate decay

epoch: one pass through the training set

If batch gradient descent in a deep network is taking excessively long
to find a value of the parameters that achieves a small value for the
cost function: Try mini-batch gradient descent, Try better random
initialization for the weights, Try Adam, Try tuning the learning rate.

A variant of this is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which is
equivalent to mini-batch gradient descent where each mini-batch has just
1 example. When the training set is large, SGD can be faster. But the
parameters will ``oscillate'' toward the minimum rather than converge
smoothly.

In practice, you'll often get faster results if you do not use neither
the whole training set, nor only one training example, to perform each
update. Mini-batch gradient descent uses an intermediate number of
examples for each step. With mini-batch gradient descent, you loop over
the mini-batches instead of looping over individual training examples.

The difference between gradient descent, mini-batch gradient descent and
stochastic gradient descent is the number of examples you use to perform
one update step. You have to tune a learning rate hyperparameter alpha.
With a well-turned mini-batch size, usually it outperforms either
gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent (particularly when the
training set is large).

Shuffling and Partitioning are the two steps required to build
mini-batches. Powers of two are often chosen to be the mini-batch size,
e.g., 16, 32, 64, 128.

Momentum takes into account the past gradients to smooth out the update

Momentum takes past gradients into account to smooth out the steps of
gradient descent. It can be applied with batch gradient descent,
mini-batch gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. You have to
tune a momentum hyperparameter beta and a learning rate alpha.

Mini-batch Gradient descent, Mini-batch Gradient descent with momentum,
mini-batch with Adam. Adam usually performs best. Some advantages of
Adam include: Relatively low memory requirements (though higher than
gradient descent and gradient descent with momentum), usually works well
even with little tuning of hyperparameters (except alpha).

\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}\label{hyperparameter-tuning}

Use random values.

batch normalization

softmax regression

During hyperparameter search, whether you try to babysit one model
(``Panda'' strategy) or train a lot of models in parallel (``Caviar'')
is largely determined by computational power

Which of the following statements about γ and β in Batch Norm are true?
They can be learned using Adam, Gradient descent with momentum, or
RMSprop, not just with gradient descent. They set the mean and variance
of the linear variable z{[}l{]} of a given layer.

After training a neural network with Batch Norm, at test time, to
evaluate the neural network on a new example you should: Perform the
needed normalizations, use μ and σ2 estimated using an exponentially
weighted average across mini-batches seen during training

tf: To summarize, remember to initialize your variables, create a
session and run the operations inside the session.

When you code in tensorflow you have to take the following steps:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Create a graph containing Tensors (Variables, Placeholders \ldots{})
  and Operations (tf.matmul, tf.add, \ldots{})
\item
  Create a session
\item
  Initialize the session
\item
  Run the session to execute the graph
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Probabilistic Programming}\label{probabilistic-programming}

\url{https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-bayesian-linear-regression-e66e60791ea7}

Bayes Rule:

old\_prob {[}P(h)/p(\textasciitilde{}h){]} * strength\_of\_evidence
{[}p(e\textbar{}h)/p(e\textbar{}\textasciitilde{}h){]} = new\_prob
{[}p(h\textbar{}e)/p(\textasciitilde{}h\textbar{}e){]}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Models have a lot of parameters classical methods that use simple
  point estimates of the parameters don't adequately capture uncertainty
  so we turn to Bayesian methods because Bayesian inference is one way
  of finding a large model with metadata.
\item
  The second reason we use Bayesian inference is for combining
  information you might have experimental data on the drug under one
  condition and aggregate data under another condition we can combine
  polls and election forecast of public opinion data from multiple poles
  and environmental statistics we have measurements of different quality
  Bayesian methods are particularly adapted tocombining information.
\item
  The third appeal of Bayesian methods and the sort of applications that
  I work on is that the inferences can map directly to decisions based
  on inferences express not its estimates and standard errors but rather
  as probability distributions we can take these probability
  distributions and pipe them directly into decision analysis for these
  reasons.
\item
  An advantage of recognizing that the prior distribution is a testable
  part of a Bayesian model is that it clarifies the role of the prior
  inference, and where it comes from.
\item
  Approximate Bayesian Computation
\item
  Laplace approximation: Approximate the posterior of a non-conjugate
  model
\item
  When one uses likelihood to get point estimates of model parameters,
  it's called maximum-likelihood estimation, or MLE. If one also takes
  the prior into account, then it's maximum a posteriori estimation
  (MAP). MLE and MAP are the same if the prior is uniform.
\item
  Beta conjugacy: Beta for prior \& binomial for likelihoood implies
  beta for posterior. Update: beta(alpha + successes, beta + failures).
  Mean: alpha/(alpha + beta)
\item
  Small alpha and beta means the prior is less informative
\item
  Empirical Bayes is an approximation to more exact Bayesian methods.
  With a lot of data it is a very good approximation.

\section{Doing Bayesian DA}\label{doing-bayesian-da}

In general, Bayesian analysis of data follows these steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Identify the data relevant to the research questions. What are the
  measurement scales of the data? Which data variables are to be
  predicted, and which data variables are supposed to act as predictors?
\item
  Define a descriptive model for the relevant data. The mathematical
  form and its parameters should be meaningful and appropriate to the
  theoretical purposes of the analysis.
\item
  Specify a prior distribution on the parameters. The prior must pass
  muster with the audience of the analysis, such as skeptical
  scientists.
\item
  Use Bayesian inference to re-allocate credibility across parameter
  values. Interpret the posterior distribution with respect to
  theoretically meaningful issues (assuming that the model is a
  reasonable description of the data; see next step).
\item
  Check that the posterior predictions mimic the data with reasonable
  accuracy (i.e., conduct a ``posterior predictive check''). If not,
  then consider a different descriptive model.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Statistical Rethinking}\label{statistical-rethinking}

bayesian: 1) likelihood: binomial 2) parameters of the likelihood 3)
prior for each param

Data are measured and known; parameters are unknown and must be
estimated from data.

Compared to MCMC, variational inference tends to be faster and easier to
scale to large data

To combat under/overfitting use a regularizing prior or a scoring device
like information criteria.

As you'll see once you start using AIC and related measures, it is true
that predictor variables that do improve prediction are not always
statistically significant. It is also possible for variables that are
statistically significant to do nothing useful for prediction.

But the prior on β is narrower and is meant to regularize. The prior β
\textasciitilde{} Normal(0,1) says that, before seeing the data, the
machine should be very skeptical of values above 2 and below −2, as a
Gaussian prior with a standard deviation of 1 assigns only 5\%
plausibility to values above and below 2 standard deviations. Because
the predictor variable x is standardized, you can interpret this as
meaning that a change of 1 standard deviation in x is very unlikely to
produce 2 units of change in the outcome.

metrics: dic, waic

Sampling from the posterior now and plotting the model's predictions
would help immensely with interpretation. And that's the course I want
to encourage and provide code for. In general, it's not safe to
interpret interactions without plotting them.

bayesian model: generative model (binomial number of success) + prior
(eg. sample of probabilities of success from uniform)

bayesian inference: bayesian model + data

bayesian inference is conditioning on the data to learn the parameter
values.

The reason that we call it posterior is because it represents the
uncertainty after (that is, posterior to) having included the
information in the data.

Quantile Regression models the median while Linear Regression models the
mean

Linear Regression - BLUE: Best Linear Unbiased (average amount wrong by
is error) Estimator

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  With large data we can to the train x dev x test split of 98 x 1 x 1.
\end{itemize}

Bayes optimal error: Aim for this. The difference b/w training error and
BOE is the avoidable bias.

end to end deep learning: an end-to-end approach as it maps directly the
input (x) to the output (y). end-to-end learning works better in
practice than multi-task learning, but requires a large amount of data.

new data degrades your model. what should you do? Use the data you have
to define a new evaluation metric (using a new dev/test set) taking into
account the new species, and use that to drive further progress for your
team.

because even though you have higher overall accuracy, you have more
false negatives (failing to raise an alarm when a bird is in the air).
What should you do? Rethink the appropriate metric for this task, and
ask your team to tune to the new metric.

If you overfit to the dev set, get a bigger one.

Spend a few days training a basic model and see what mistakes it makes.

softmax not used for multi-classification

\begin{itemize}
\item
  But map allows us to bypass the function function. Using a tilda
  (\textasciitilde{}) in place of function and a dot (.) in place of x,
  we can do this: map(dat, \textasciitilde{}mean(.\$Open))

\item
  \textbf{The Coefficient of Unalikeability}: Unalikeability is defined
  as how often observations differ from one another. It varies from 0 to
  1. The higher the value, the more unalike the data are.
\end{itemize}

Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on
heuristics such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions
are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the
globally optimal decision tree. To reduce the greedy effect of local
optimality, some methods such as the dual information distance (DID)
tree were proposed

Laplace smoothing/estimator in Naive Bayes: To see why consider the
worst case where none of the words in the training sample appear in the
test sentence. In this case, under your model we would conclude that the
sentence is impossible but it clearly exists creating a contradiction.

Zero correlation doesn't imply independence

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Active Learning: Finding the optimal data to manually label
\item
  Simulated Annealing: Gradient descent extension
\item
  ``No Free Lunch'' theorem: no single classifier works best across all
  possible scenarios
\item
  So, if your problem involves kind of searching a needle in the
  haystack when for ex: the positive class samples are very rare
  compared to the negative classes, use a precision recall curve.
  Otherwise use a ROC curve because a ROC curve remains the same
  regardless of the baseline prior probability of your positive class
  (the important rare class).
\item
  Sequence mining Algorithms: spade, gsp, freespan; hmmlearn
\item
  Network models: graphical lasso, ising model, granger causality test,
  network hypothesis testing, bayesian networks
\item
  Parametric: Model has a function shape and form, Model is trained/fit
  using training data to determine parameter values, reduces the problem
  of training a model down to training a set of parameter values,
  Examples: linear regression. Non-Parametric: No assumption about model
  form is made, Example: KNN
\item
  The ML Fine Print: Three basic assumptions: 1) We draw examples
  independently and identically (i.i.d.) at random from the
  distribution, 2) The distribution is stationary: It doesn't change
  over time, 3) We always pull from the same distribution: Including
  training, validation, and test sets. In practice, we sometimes violate
  these assumptions. For example: 1) Consider a model that chooses ads
  to display. The i.i.d. assumption would be violated if the model bases
  its choice of ads, in part, on what ads the user has previously seen.
  2) Consider a data set that contains retail sales information for a
  year. User's purchases change seasonally, which would violate
  stationarity. When we know that any of the preceding three basic
  assumptions are violated, we must pay careful attention to metrics.
\item
  empirical risk minimization: In supervised learning, a machine
  learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and
  attempting to find a model that minimizes loss.
\item
  Loss is the penalty for a bad prediction. That is, loss is a number
  indicating how bad the model's prediction was on a single example. If
  the model's prediction is perfect, the loss is zero; otherwise, the
  loss is greater.
\item
  If a model suffers from overfitting, we also say that the model has a
  high variance, which can be caused by having too many parameters that
  lead to a model that is too complex given the underlying data.
  Similarly, our model can also suffer from underfitting (high bias),
  which means that our model is not complex enough to capture the
  pattern in the training data well and therefore also suffers from low
  performance on unseen data.
\item
  ``Product classification is an example of multicategory or multinomial
  classification. Most classification problems and most classification
  algorithms are specialized for two-category, or binomial,
  classification. There are tricks to using binary classifiers to solve
  multicategory problems (for example, building one classifier for each
  category, called a ``one versus rest'' classifier). But in most cases
  it's worth the effort to find a suitable multiple-category
  implementation, as they tend to work better than multiple binary
  classifiers (for example, using the package mlogit instead of the base
  method glm() for logistic regression).''

  Spark's assumes the target is called `label' in ML. Everything else is
  a feature.
\item
  alias() method to rename a column you're selecting.
\item

\item
  withColumn(): create new column
\item
  pyspark.ml.feature
\item
  At the core of the pyspark.ml module are the Transformer and Estimator
  classes. Transformer classes are used for pre-processing and have a
  .transform() method. eg. PCA
\item
  You can create what are called `one-hot vectors' to represent the
  carrier and the destination of each flight. A one-hot vector is a way
  of representing a categorical feature where every observation has a
  vector in which all elements are zero except for at most one element,
  which has a value of one (1).
\item
  Estimator classes are for modeling and all implement a .fit() method.
  eg. StringIndexerModel for including categorical data saved as strings
  in your models
\item
  selectExpr() takes SQL expressions as a string
\item
  show() vs collect()
\item
  Spark only handles numeric data
\item
  In Spark it's important to make sure you split the data after all the
  transformations. This is because operations like StringIndexer don't
  always produce the same index even when given the same list of
  strings.

  To collect your data: that is, to move it from Spark to R, you call
  collect(). copy\_to() moves your data from R to Spark.

\subsection{Model Selection}\label{model-selection-1}

Now that you have fit two models to the churn dataset, it's time to
compare their out-of-sample predictions and choose which one is the best
model for your dataset.

You can compare models in caret using the resamples() function, provided
they have the same training data and use the same trainControl object
with preset cross-validation folds. resamples() takes as input a list of
models and can be used to compare dozens of models at once (though in
this case you are only comparing two models).

\subsection{Stacking}\label{stacking}

caretEnsemble provides the caretList() function for creating multiple
caret models at once on the same dataset, using the same resampling
folds. You can also create your own lists of caret models. Use the
caretStack() function to make a stack of caret models, with the two
sub-models (glmnet and ranger) feeding into another (hopefully more
accurate!) caret model.
