<li>Dealing with cyclical features: Hours of the day, days of the week, months in a year, and wind direction are all examples of features that are cyclical. Many new machine learning engineers don’t think to convert these features into a representation that can preserve information such as hour 23 and hour 0 being close to each other and not far. Keeping with the hour example, the best way to handle this is to calculate the sin and cos component so that you represent your cyclical feature as (x,y) coordinates of a circle. In this representation hour, 23 and hour 0 are right next to each other numerically, just as they should be.</li>

<li><p>To work around magic values, convert the feature into two features: One feature holds only quality ratings, never magic values. One feature holds a boolean value indicating whether or not a quality_rating was supplied. Give this boolean feature a name like is_quality_rating_defined.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure that your test set meets the following two conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is large enough to yield statistically meaningful results.</p></li>
<li><p>Is representative of the data set as a whole. In other words, don’t pick a test set with different characteristics than the training set.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Handling extreme outliers: Given data with a very long tail, log scaling does a slightly better job, but there’s still a significant tail of outlier values. Let’s pick yet another approach. What if we simply “cap” or “clip” the maximum value at an arbitrary value, say 4.0? Clipping the feature value at 4.0 doesn’t mean that we ignore all values greater than 4.0. Rather, it means that all values that were greater than 4.0 now become 4.0. This explains the funny hill at 4.0. Despite that hill, the scaled feature set is now more useful than the original data. Binning.</p></li>
<li><p>Know your data. Follow these rules: 1) Keep in mind what you think your data should look like. 2) Verify that the data meets these expectations (or that you can explain why it doesn’t). 3) Double-check that the training data agrees with other sources (for example, dashboards).</p></li>

<li><p>The standard least squares coefficient estimates are scale equivariant: if we multiply a predictor variable by a constant, the corresponding least squares coefficient estimate will be scaled down by the same constant.</p></li>
<li><p>Used when you’re predicting a continuous value.</p></li>
<li><p>In regression, it is often recommended to center the variables so that the predictors have mean 0. This makes it so the intercept term is interpreted as the expected value of Y_i when the predictor values are set to their means. Otherwise, the intercept is interpreted as the expected value of Y_i when the predictors are set to 0, which may not be a realistic or interpretable situation.</p></li>
<li><p>When p &gt; n, we can no longer calculate a unique least square coefficient estimate, the variances become infinite, so OLS cannot be used at all.</p></li>
<li><p>In presence of few variables with medium / large sized effect, use lasso regression. In presence of many variables with small / medium sized effect, use ridge regression.</p></li>
<li><p>The fitted regression line using a sample of data gives imperfect predictions for future observations due to sampling variability and randomness in Y that is not related to X.</p></li>
<li><p>Linear Correlation =&gt; Causation if covariates respect: linearity normality indep homoscedasticity + all confounders in model</p></li>
<li><p>In summary, “pooling” your data and fitting one combined regression function allows you to easily and efficiently answer research questions concerning the binary predictor variable.</p></li>
<li><p>If two independent variables are measured in exactly the same units, we can asses their relative importance in their effect on y quite simply: the larger the coefficient, the stronger the effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Okay, so many of the features are strongly correlated. We can make use of this in our model by including polynomial features (e.g. PolynomialFeatures(degree=2) from scikit-learn). Adding these brings our validation loss down to 0.69256 (-0.05% from baseline).</p></li>
<li><p>We prefer natural logs (that is, logarithms base e) because, as described above, coefficients on the natural-log scale are directly interpretable as approximate proportional differences: with a coefficient of 0.06, a difference of 1 in x corresponds to an approximate 6% difference in y, and so forth.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Assumptions</h3>
<p>The regression assumption that is generally least important is that the errors are normally distributed. In fact, for the purpose of estimating the regression line (as compared to predicting individual data points), the assumption of normality is barely important at all. Thus, in contrast to many regression textbooks, we do not recommend diagnostics of the normality of regression residuals. [Gelman]</p>
<p>Linear regression errors are not autocorrelated. The Durbin-Watson statistic detects this; if it is close to 2, there is no autocorrelation.</p>
<p>A linear regression model is only as good as the validity of its assumptions, which can be summarized as: <span class="math inline">\(y = b_0+b_1x + \epsilon\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> is i.i.d from N(0, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>). More verbosely:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Linearity: This is a linear relationship between the predictor and the response variables. If this relationship is not clearly present, transformations (log, polynomial, exponent and so on) of the X or Y may solve the problem. Check with a scatterplot.</p></li>
<li><p>Normality: The error terms are drawn from an identical Gaussian distribution, i.e a normal distribution of the dependent variable for each value of the independent variable. Inspect the quantile-quantile plot of the residuals. Also Shapiro-Wilk Test for Normality.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-correlation or independence of errors: A common problem in the time series and panel data where en = betan-1; if the errors are correlated, you run the risk of creating a poorly specified model. The residual value for an arbitrary observation is not predictable from knowledge of another observation’s residual value; they are uncorrelated. Inspect the residual plot after fitting the regression. Ideally, there would be no clear pattern in the fluctuation of the error terms.</p></li>
<li><p>Homoscedasticity (constant variance): Normally the distributed and constant variance of errors, which means that the variance of the errors is constant across the different values of inputs. Violations of this assumption can create biased coefficient estimates, leading to statistical tests for significance that can be either too high or too low. This, in turn, leads to the wrong conclusion. This violation is referred to as heteroscedasticity. The error terms have the same variance. Check the residual plot which is a scatterplot of the residuals vs the fitted values.</p></li>
<li><p>No multi-colinearity: No linear relationship between two predictor variables, which is to say that there should be no correlation between the features. This, again, can lead to biased estimates. If not coefficient estimates could be unstable, introduce redundancies within predictors, and make it more difficult to make inferences. Could inflate standard errors, decrease power and reliability of regression coefficients, and create need for a larger sample size. Check the variance inflation factors. Tells the factor by which the estimated variance of a variable is larger in comparison ti it it were completely uncorrelated with other variables in the model. If the VIF is more than five then the variable is a candidate to remove from the model. Its information is contained in the other variables. Variance Inflation Factor: MEasures how the model facotrs influence hte uncertainity of coefficient estimates. &gt;=5 is bad.</p></li>
<li><p>Minimal outliers: Outliers can severely skew the estimation and, ideally, must be removed prior to fitting a model using linear regression; this again can lead to a biased estimate.</p></li>

<p>Outliers are observations that have high residual values. Leverage points are observations that have unusually small or large independent variable values. Cook’s distance helps to measure the effect of deleting an observation from the #dataset and rerunning the regression. Observations that have large residual values and also high leverage tend to pose threats to the accuracy of the regression line and thus need to be further investigated. Look at influence plot. Confidence and prediction intervals. For avplot distinct patterns are indications of good contributions. Influence plot to look at hat values (lower is better). Use F-test to compare models.

<p>Box-Cox: Iterates along values of lambda by maximum likelihood so as to maximize the fit of the transformed variable to a normal distribution.

<li><p>F-Test: H_0 says that all/some coefficients are zero versus H_a which says that there is at least one non-zero coefficient. If h0 fail to reject than F value close to 1, else F value greater than 1.</p></li>

<p>Minimizes RSS but also has shrinkage penalty (L2 penalty). A small lambda penalizes the RSS more than the shrinkage penalty. A large lambda penalizes the shrinkage penalty more than the RSS. By shrinking the coefficient estimates towards 0 by increasing lambda, the bias increases slightly but remains relatively small, the variance reduces substantially, and the mean squared error of the predictions drops. Not scale invariant due to the shrinkage penalty. To avoid the issue of overvaluing or undervaluing certain predictor variables simply based on their magnitudes, we must standardize the variables prior to performing ridge regression. The main disadvantage of ridge regression is that, while parameter estimates are shrunken, they only asymptotically approach 0 as we increase the value of lambda.</p>
<p>Standardize for ridge/lasso alpha makes them not scale invariant</p>
<p>Minimizes RSS but also has L1 penalty (norm). This necessarily forcessome coefficient estimates to be exactly 0 (when lambda is sufficiently large). It has the added advantage of essentially performing variable selection, yielding models that are both accurate and parsimonious. Restricting ourselves to simpler models by including a Lasso penalty will generally decrease the variance of the fits at the cost of higher bias.</p>
<p>Note: In both ridge and lasso regression, is important to select an appropriate value of lambda by means of cross-validation.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Logistic Regression</h2>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.1</span> Intro</h3>
<p>logistic is the same as probit</p>
<p>wilkinson rogers logistic regression</p>
<p>weighted logistic regression</p>
<p>The right-hand predictor side of the equation must be linear with the left-hand outcome side of the equation. You must test for linearity in the logit (in logistic regression the logit is the outcome side). This is commonly done with the Box-Tidwell Transformation (Test): Add to the logistic model interaction terms which are the crossproduct of each independent times its natural logarithm [(X)ln(X)]. If these terms are significant, then there is nonlinearity in the logit. This method is not sensitive to small nonlinearities.</p>
<p>Logistic regression assumes that logit(y) is linear in the values of x. Like linear regression, logistic regression will find the best coefficients to predict y, including finding advantageous combinations and cancellations when the inputs are correlated. In other words, you can think of logistic regression as a linear regression that finds the log-odds of the probability that you’re interested in. Logistic Regression can also be used with kernel methods.</p>
<p>Logistic: When you’re predicting which category your observation is in. (Is this is a cat or a dog?)</p>
<p>The link function is the logit function. Logit is the inverse of the sigmoid and gives the log odds, i.e p/(1-p).</p>
<p>Easy to incorpotate prior knowledge, number fo features are small, training is fast, precision not critical.</p>
<p>No closed form expression to maximize coefficients with maximum likelihood estimation, so one uses gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent. The second one is faster.</p>
<p>For logistic regression value of c penalizes features. Low c penalizes a lot and vice versa. A large c decreases the effect of the regularization term (the l2 penalization).</p>
<p>Makes a linear boundary between classes.</p>
<p>For multiclass classification it will build multiple models. Given 3 classes 0,1, and 2, there will be models 0 and not 0, 1 and not 1, and 2 and not 2.</p>
<p>Standardization isn’t required for logistic regression. The main goal of standardizing features is to help convergence of the technique used for optimization. For example, if you use Newton-Raphson to maximize the likelihood, standardizing the features makes the convergence faster. Otherwise, you can run your logistic regression without any standardization treatment on the features.</p>

<div id="assumptions-2" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.6.2</span> Assumptions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The linear regression analysis requires all variables to be multivariate normal. This assumption can best be checked with a histogram or a Q-Q-Plot.</p></li>
<li><p>Requires the dependent variable to be binary and ordinal logistic regression requires the dependent variable to be ordinal.</p></li>
<li><p>The observations to be independent of each other. In other words, the observations should not come from repeated measurements or matched data.</p></li>
<li><p>There to be little or no multicollinearity among the independent variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Assumes linearity of independent variables and logit of the probabilities (logit(p) = log(p/(1-p))). Check <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/169348/how-should-i-check-the-assumption-of-linearity-to-the-logit-for-the-continuous-i">in R</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no influential values (extreme values or outliers) in the continuous predictors</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the points fall along a line in the middle of the graph, but curve off in the extremities. Normal Q-Q plots that exhibit this behavior usually mean your data have more extreme values than would be expected if they truly came from a Normal distribution.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.10</span> K-Means Clustering [US]</h2>
<div id="intro-5" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.10.1</span> Intro</h3>
<p>K-Means clustering method considers two assumptions regarding the clusters – first that the clusters are spherical and second that the clusters are of similar size.</p>
<p>k-means assumes the variance of the distribution of each attribute (variable) is spherical; all variables have the same variance;</p>
<p>the prior probability for all k clusters is the same, i.e., each cluster has roughly equal number of observations;</p>
<p>Must choose k for clusters. Initialize cluster centes randomly, assign each point to its closest cluster by a distance metric. Recalculate centroids. Halt when cluster assignments no longer change. Clusters will be distinct and non-overlapping. Goal to minimize within-cluster variation. The within-cluster variation for the kth cluster is the sum of all of the pairwise squared Euclidean distances between the observations in the kth cluster divided by the total number of observations in the kth cluster. Limitation is that it depends on initialization of centroids. Guaranteed convergence but only to a local minima. Run the algorithm several times and pick the solution that yields the smallest within-cluster variance. Increasing k will decrease variance and increase bias and vice versa. K-means: Jaccard coefficient.</p>
<p>Note: Not enough to use within-cluster variance as this decreases as one increases k. Use elbow method or scree plot to choose optimal k where the variance no longer decreases dramatically. To choose how many groups to use, I ran a k-means analysis for each possible number of groups from 5 to 35 and found that 20 was right about the spot that the amount of variance stopped decreasing consistently. This is called the elbow test and while the results weren’t totally definitive, they fit in well with the general rule of thumb for determining # of groups which is the square root of the # of observations/2.</p>
<p>One way to assess whether a cluster represents true structure is to see if the cluster holds up under plausible variations in the dataset. The fpc package has a function called clusterboot() that uses bootstrap resampling to evaluate how stable a given cluster is.[3] clusterboot() is an integrated function that both performs the clustering and evaluates the final produced clusters. It has interfaces to a number of R clustering algorithms, including both hclust and kmeans.</p>
<p>In K-means, we assume that each cluster fits a Gaussian distribution (normal distribution)</p>
<p>We can set K to optimally cluster the data by starting with a small number of clusters, and then iteratively splitting them until all clusters fit a normal distribution.</p>

<p>Generates dendrograms. The lower down a fusion occurs the more similar the group of observations and vice versa. Begin with n observations and a distance measure of all pairwise dissimialirities. Evaluate pairwise intercluster dissimiliarities among the clusters and fuse pair of clusters that are least dissimilar. Repeat process for remaining clusters. Continue for i=n to i=2. Need to pick a dissimilarity measure and a linkage method. Complete linkage: maximal inter-cluster dissimilarity, single linkage: minimal inter-cluster dissimilarity, avergae linkage: mean inter-cluster dissimilarity. Complete is sensitive to outliers but tends to produce compact clusters. Distance between groups: complete, average, and ward. Single not as sensitive to outliers but susceptible to chaining effect where clusters can often not represent intuitive groups. Average strikes a balance between the two. Usually standardize data before clustering. Sklearn.metrics has pairwise distances.</p>
<p>K-Means vs Hierarchical Clustering: K-means clustering needs the number of clusters to be speciﬁed. Hierarchical clustering doesn’t need the number of clusters to be speciﬁed. K-means clustering is usually more effcient run-time wise.</p>

<li><p>Center and scale data. The eigenvectors yield orthogonal directions of greatest variability(principal components). The eigenvalues correspond to the magnitude of variancealong the principal components. Interpretability is a negative. PCA is completely nonparametric: any data set can be plugged in and an answer comes out, requiring no parameters to tweak and no regard for how the data was recorded. From one perspective, the fact that PCA is non-parametric (or plug-and-play) can be considered a positive feature because the answer is unique and independent of the user. From another perspective the fact that PCA is agnostic to the source of the data is also a weakness. When using dimensional reduction we restrict ourselves to simpler models. Thus, we expect bias to increase and variance to decrease. Getting latent components. Visualize high dimensional data. Reduce noise. Preprocessing. scale and center data before doing. Needs regularization. Too many principal components F1 score starts to drop after increase. Best F1 is 1. set number of components. Use fit_transforms, use explained_variance_ratio_ to see how much of the variance is explained by each component.

<p>It is also possible to decompress the reduced dataset back to 784 dimensions by applying the inverse transformation of the PCA projection. Of course this won’t give you back the original data, since the projection lost a bit of information (within the 5% variance that was dropped), but it will likely be quite close to the original data. The mean squared distance between the original data and the reconstructed data (compressed and then decompressed) is called the reconstruction error.</p>
<p>It turns out that many things behave very differently in high-dimensional space. For example, if you pick a random point in a unit square (a 1 × 1 square), it will have only about a 0.4% chance of being located less than 0.001 from a border (in other words, it is very unlikely that a random point will be “extreme” along any dimension). But in a 10,000-dimensional unit hypercube (a 1 × 1 × ⋯ × 1 cube, with ten thousand 1s), this probability is greater than 99.999999%. Most points in a high-dimensional hypercube are very close to the border.</p>
<p>Before looking at the PCA algorithm for dimensionality reduction in more detail, let’s summarize the approach in a few simple steps: Standardize the -dimensional dataset.</p>
<p>Construct the covariance matrix.Decompose the covariance matrix into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Select eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues, where is the dimensionality of the new feature subspace ().</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.14</span> SVM</h2>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.14.1</span> Intro</h3>
<p>Selection of margin in SVM is a convex optimization problem. What is the objective of the maximum margin approach? To ensure small prediction error when the underlying distribution is not known</p>
<p>The LinearSVC class regularizes the bias term, so you should center the training set first by subtracting its mean. This is automatic if you scale the data using the StandardScaler. Moreover, make sure you set the loss hyperparameter to “hinge”, as it is not the default value. Finally, for better performance you should set the dual hyperparameter to False, unless there are more features than training instances (we will discuss duality later in the chapter).</p>
<p>With so many kernels to choose from, how can you decide which one to use? As a rule of thumb, you should always try the linear kernel first (remember that LinearSVC is much faster than SVC(kernel=“linear”)), especially if the training set is very large or if it has plenty of features. If the training set is not too large, you should try the Gaussian RBF kernel as well; it works well in most cases. Then if you have spare time and computing power, you can also experiment with a few other kernels using cross-validation and grid search, especially if there are kernels specialized for your training set’s data structure.</p>
<p>Here mostly talking about a maximal margin classifier. A separating hyperline of data of two classes. Maximizes distance to the nearest point in either class, i.e, the margin. Points which delineate the boundary are called support vectors. Correct classification first and then maximizing the margin. SVM only really works well with linear hyperplanes. The c hyperparameter deals with the tradeoff between a smooth decision boundary and correct classification. The larger the c the more points classified correctly as it increases the penalty for wrong classification. A smaller c gives more room for intial error which helps improve accuracy for not easily separable data. Work well in complicated domains with clear line of separation. Not so well in for large datasets because of training and not when there is a lot of noise. Can solve nonlinear decision boundaries by using polynomial terms. Kernel trick that draws boundaries by looking into higher dimensions.</p>
<p>Extracting the coefficients from the hyperplane equation (not including the intercept) yields what is called a normal vector. This vector points in a direction orthogonal to the surface of the hyperplane and essentially defines its orientation.</p>
<p>Big data set and lot of features SVM might be slow and prone to overfitting. SVM slower than naïve bayes. A kernelis a function that quantifies the similarity of two observations. The beauty of the “kernel trick” is that, even if there is an infinite-dimensional basis, we need only look at the n^2 inner products between training data points. SVM not scale invariant. Check if library normalizes by default. RBF kernel is a good default. Try exponential sequences for parameters.</p>
<p>Extension of above info about relaxing margin. Doesn’t perfectly separate classes but is more robust to outliers. Helps better classify obervations. Take a penalty by potentially misclassifying soe observations. Have better predictive power. Called a soft margin. The C parameter is the budget for the slack variables which tell where observations are relative to the margin and hyperplane. Only observations that either fall on the margin or violate the margin affect the solution to the optimization problem. More robust than SVM.</p>
<p>When the support vector classifier is combined with a non-linear kernel, the resulting classifier is called a support vector machine.</p>
<p>Note: Important to make sure the normal vector is of unit length. For the radial kernel, suppose we have a test observation. If it is far from a training observation, the Euclidean distance will be large, but the value of the radial kernel will be small. using kernels is much more computationally efficientbecause we only need to compute the kernel for distinct pairs of observations in our dataset. Furthermore, we need not actually work in the enlarged feature space. Intuitively, the gamma parameter defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches, with low values meaning ‘far’ and high values meaning ‘close’. The gamma parameters can be seen as the inverse of the radius of influence of samples selected by the model as support vectors.</p>
<p>Multiclass</p>
<p>1v1: Construct a support vector machine for each pair of categories. For each classifier, record the prediction for each observation. Have the classifiers vote on the prediction for each observation.</p>
<p>1vAll: Construct a support vector machine for each individual category against all other categories combined. Assign the observation to the classifier with the largest function value.</p>

<div id="intro-10" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.15.1</span> Intro</h3>
<p>So should you use Gini impurity or entropy? The truth is, most of the time it does not make a big difference: they lead to similar trees. Gini impurity is slightly faster to compute, so it is a good default. However, when they differ, Gini impurity tends to isolate the most frequent class in its own branch of the tree, while entropy tends to produce slightly more balanced trees.</p>
<p>Decision Trees make very few assumptions about the training data (as opposed to linear models, which obviously assume that the data is linear, for example). Such a model is often called a nonparametric model, not because it does not have any parameters (it often has a lot) but because the number of parameters is not determined prior to training, so the model structure is free to stick closely to the data.</p>
<p>More generally, the main issue with Decision Trees is that they are very sensitive to small variations in the training data. For example, if you just remove the widest Iris-Versicolor from the iris training set (the one with petals 4.8 cm long and 1.8 cm wide) and train a new Decision Tree, you may get the model represented in Figure 6-8. As you can see, it looks very different from the previous Decision Tree (Figure 6-2). Actually, since the training algorithm used by Scikit-Learn is stochastic6 you may get very different models even on the same training data (unless you set the random_state hyperparameter).</p>
<p>Construct solutions that stratify the feature space into relatively easy to describe regions. Partition predictor space into rectangular or box-like regions. For regression predict the meant of the reponse variables in each region for the training observations in that space. Top down and greedy approach called recursive binary spltting to find ebst solution. Greedy because splits based on best result. The recursive binary splitting process depends on the greatest reduction in the RSS. Entropy very important. Decides where tree splits. Measure of impurity in examples. Entropy between 0 and 1. 0 means no impurity. Maximial is 1 when there is an even split between options. Key term: information gain. Decisions tree maximize this. Easy to interpret, prone to overfitting. Where each data point has its own node, the variance is high and the training error is 0. Deciding on the number of splits prior to building a tree isn’t the best strategy. The best subtree will be the one that yields the lowest test error rate. Given a subtree, we can estimate the test error by implementing the crossvalidationprocess, but this is too cumbersome because the large number of possible subtrees. The tuning parameter alpha helps balance the tradeoff between the overall complexity of the tree and its fit to the training data. Small values of alpha yield trees that are quite extensive (have many terminal nodes). Large values of alpha yield trees that are quite limited (have few terminal nodes). Similar to ridge/lasso regression. Ultimately, the subtree that is used for prediction is built using all of the available data with the determined optimal value of alpha.</p>
<p>Regression: Use cost complexity pruning to build set of subtrees as a function of lambda. Classification: Use Gini index, measures total variance among classes.</p>
<p>Note: Duplicate splits happen when they increase node purity. While pruning reduces the variance of the overall tree model upon repeated builds with different datasets, we induce biasbecause the trees are much simpler.</p>

<div id="intro-11" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.16.1</span> Intro</h3>
<p>used to decrease variance in decision trees</p>
<p>How it works: train multiple trees using bootstrapped datasets, regression trees: average the predictions from all the trees, classification: take a majority vote of the predictions, majority vote: the class which occurs most frequently, Out of bag (OOB) error, Only a portion of the data is used to train each tree, The remaining data which wasn’t selected can be used to assess the tree’s performance, (the response for each observation is predicted using only the trees that were not fit using that observation)</p>
<p>Bagging involves randomly generating Bootstrap samples from the dataset and trains the models individually. Predictions are then made by aggregating or averaging all the response variables:For example, consider a dataset (Xi, Yi), where i=1 …n, contains n data points.Now, randomly select B samples with replacements from the original dataset using Bootstrap technique.Next, train the B samples with regression/classification models independently. Then, predictions are made on the test set by averaging the responses from all the B models generated in the case of regression. Alternatively, the most often occurring class among B samples is generated in the case of classification.</p>
<p>Bagging stabilizes decision trees and improves accuracy by reducing variance.</p>
<p>Bagging reduces generalization error.</p>
<p>Take repeated samples of the same size from the single overall training dataset. Treat these different sets of data as pseudo-training sets. Fitting separate, independent decision treesto each of the bootstrapped training data sets. We can then average all predictions (or take the majority vote) to obtain the bagged estimate. Instead of pruning back our trees, create very large trees in the first place. These large trees will tend to have low bias, but high variance. Retain the low bias, but get rid of the high variance by averaging. Con is that the trees are correlation. train multiple trees using bootstrapped data to reduce variance and prevent overfitting</p>

<div id="intro-12" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.17.1</span> Intro</h3>
<p>Build a number of decision trees using bootstrapped samples</p>
<p>At each split in the tree only a portion of the features are considered</p>
<p>a feature is selected from a subset of features not the whole feature space</p>
<p>the subset is usually sqrt(n.features)</p>
<p>This allows trees to be built without some of the strong features decorrelates the trees, unlike bagging</p>
<p>Random forests are improvised supervised algorithms than bootstrap aggregation or bagging methods, though they are built on a similar approach. Unlike selecting all the variables in all the B samples generated using the Bootstrap technique in bagging, we select only a few predictor variables randomly from the total variables for each of the B samples. Then, these samples are trained with the models. Predictions are made by averaging the result of each model. The number of predictors in each sample is decided using the formula m = √p, where p is the total variable count in the original dataset.Here are some key <a href="notes:This" class="uri">notes:This</a> approach removes the condition of dependency of strong predictors in the dataset as we intentionally select fewer variables.</p>
<p>Draw a random bootstrap sample of size n (randomly choose n samples from the training set with replacement).Grow a decision tree from the bootstrap sample. At each node:Randomly select d features without replacement.Split the node using the feature that provides the best split according to the objective function, for instance, by maximizing the information gain.Repeat the steps 1 to 2 k times.Aggregate the prediction by each tree to assign the class label by majority vote. Majority voting will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 7, Combining Different Models for Ensemble Learning.</p>
<p>Random forests further improve decision tree performance by de-correlating the individual trees in the bagging ensemble.</p>
<p>Random forests decorrelate tree it generates and thus results in a reduction in variance. Similar to bagging, we first build various decision trees on bootstrapped training samples, but we split internal nodes in a special way. Each time a split is considered within the construction of a decision tree, only a random subset of ᬊthe overall predictors are allowed to be candidates. At every split, a new subset of predictors is randomly selected. The random forest procedure forces the decision tree building process to use different predictors to split at different times. Should a good predictor be left out of consideration for some splits, it still has many chances to be consideredin the construction of other splits. We can’t overfit by adding more trees. The variance just ends up decreasing. Out of bag score is a good estimate of the test score and is the non-bootstrapped data. Need to turn on this scoing method. Error Rate: Depends on correlation between trees (higher is worse), strength of single trees (higher is better). Increasing number of features for each split increases correlation and strength of single trees.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.18</span> Boosting</h2>
<div id="intro-13" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.18.1</span> Intro</h3>
<p>Unlike boosting and random forests, can overfit if number of trees is too large</p>
<p>Similar to bagging, but trees are grown sequentially. Each tree is created using information from previously grown trees</p>
<p>Each tree is generated using information from previously grown trees; the addition of a new tree improves upon the performance of the previous trees. The trees are now dependentupon one another. Boosting approach tends to slowly learn our data. Given a current decision tree model, we fit a new decision tree to the residualsof the current decision tree. The new decision tree (based on the residuals) is then added to the current decision tree, and the residuals are updated. We limit the number of terminal nodes in order to sequentially fit small trees. By fitting small trees to the residuals, we slowly improve the overall model in areas where it does not perform well.</p>
<p>Note: Unlike in bagging and random forests, boosting can overfit if ᫦is large (although very slowly). Use cross-validation to select number of trees᫦. Alpha controls the rate at which boosting learns and is usually between 0.01 to 0.001. A small alpha usually goes with a large number of trees. Can also choose the number of splits. Typically using stumps (single splits d = 1) is sufficient and results in an additive model.</p>
<p>Note on Variable Importance: For regression trees, we can use the reduction in the RSS. For classification trees, we can use the reduction in the Gini index. A relatively large value indicates a notable drop in the RSS or Gini index, and thus a better fit to the data; corresponding variables are relatively important predictors.</p>

TF(i,d) is the number of times the term t appears in document d while document frequency DF(t,D) is the number of documents which contain the term t. If a term appears very often across the corpus it doesn’t carry any special info about the document. Inverse document frequency is a numerical measure of how much info a term provides.

<li><p>Seasonal Decomposition; Use additive model when the magnitude of the seasonal fluctuations surrounding the general trend doesn’t vary over time.

<p><strong>ARIMA(p,d,q) (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) Models</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>AR(p): auto-regressive component for lags on the stationary series. The AR models sayd that the value of a variable at a specific time is related to the value of the variable at previous times.</p></li>
<li><p>I(d): Integrated component for a series that needs to be differenced.</p></li>
<li><p>MA(q): Moving average component for lag of the forecast errors.

The value of a variable at a specific time is related to the residuals of prediction at previous times.</p></li>
<li><p>In an auto-regressive model of order p, each valeu in a time series is predicted from a linear combination of the previous p values.</p></li>
<li><p>Procedure: Make stationary if necessary by differencing. Determine possible values of p and q. Assess model fit and try other values of p and q to overfit. Make forecasts with the final model.</p></li>
<li><p>Augmented Dicky-Fuller Test: This tests whether or not a time series is stationary. h0: series is not stationary, ha: the series is stationary.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine p and q: Look at autocorrelation (AC) and partial correlation (PAC) functions. AC measures the way observations relate to each other. PAC measure the way observations relate to each other after accounting for all other intervening observations. Plot of the autocorrelation function (ACF) displays correlation of the series with itself at different lags. A plot of the PAC displays the amount of autocorrelation not explained by lower order correlations. Spikes in the PACF will choose for AR(p). Spikes in the ACF will choose MA(q).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assess Model Fit</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Appropriate model should resemble white noise. Check scatterplot of residuals vs fit to check constant variance and qqplot to check normality. Autocorrelations should be zero to check for violation of independent errors.</p></li>

<p>Naive vs Seasonal Naive vs Exponential Smooothing</p>
<p>Seasonal Naive: Assumes magnitude of the seasonal pattern is constant.</p>
<p>cyclical vs seasonal patterns: longer, harder to predicit, don’t follow seasonl patterns</p>
<p>ETS: Error-Trend-Seasonality</p>
<p>The possible time series (TS) scenarios can be recognized by asking the following questions:</p>
<p>TS has a trend? If yes, is the trend increasing linearly or exponentially?</p>
<p>TS has seasonality? If yes, do the seasonal components increase in magnitude over time?</p>
<p>We are going to explore four ETS models that can help forecast these possible time-series scenarios.</p>
<p>Simple Exponential Smoothing Method</p>
<p>Holt’s Linear Trend Method</p>
<p>Exponential Trend Method</p>
<p>Holt-Winters Seasonal Method</p>
<p>Time series does not have a trend line and does not have seasonality component. We would use a Simple Exponential Smoothing model.</p>
<p>Time Seies: level, trend, seasonal compoent</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>There are several methods we need to pick in order to model any given time series appropriately:</p>
<p>Simple Exponential Smoothing: Finds the level of the time series</p>
<p>Holt’s Linear Trend: Finds the level of the time series</p>
<p>Additive model for linear trend</p>
<p>Exponential Trend: Finds the level of the time series</p>
<p>Multiplicative model for exponential trend</p>
<p>Holt-Winters Seasonal: Finds the level of the time series</p>
<p>Additive for trend</p>
<p>Multiplicative and Additive for seasonal components</p>
<p>These methods help deal with different scenarios in our time series involving:</p>
<p>Linear or exponential trend</p>
<p>Constant or increasing seasonality components</p>
<p>For trends that are exponential, we would need to use a multiplicative model.</p>
<p>For increasing seasonality components, we would need to use a multiplicative model model as well.</p>
<p>ETS</p>
<p>Therefore we can generalize all of these models using a naming system for ETS:</p>
<p>ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality)</p>
<p>Error is the error line we saw in the time series decomposition part earlier in the course. If the error is increasing similar to an increasing seasonal components, we would need to consider a multiplicative design for the exponential model.</p>
<p>Therefore, for each component in the ETS system, we can assign None, Multiplicative, or Additive (or N, M, A) for each of the three components in our time series.</p>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>A time series model that has a constant error, linear trend, and increasing seasonal components means we would need to use an ETS model of:</p>
<p>ETS(N,A,M)</p>
<p>A time series model that has increasing error, exponential trend, and no seasonality means we would need to use an ETS model of:</p>
<p>ARIMA; Seasnoanl:ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)M vs non-seasonal: ARIMA(p,d,q)</p>
<p>non-=statipjary: This plot shows an upward trend and seasonality.</p>
<p>stationaey: This plot revolves around a constant mean of 0 and shows contained variance.</p>
<p>Evluated withhold set and residual plots, should have mean of 0.</p>
<p>is less sensitive to the occasional very large error because it does not square the errors in the calculation.</p>
<p>Percentage Errors</p>
<p>Percentage errors, like MAPE, are useful because they are scale independent, so they can be used to compare forecasts between different data series, unlike scale dependent errors. The disadvantage is that it cannot be used if the series has zero values.</p>
<p>Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is also often useful for purposes of reporting, because it is expressed in generic percentage terms it will make sense even to someone who has no idea what constitutes a “big” error in terms of dollars spent or widgets sold.</p>
<p>Scale-Free Errors</p>
<p>Scale-free errors were introduced more recently to offer a scale-independent measure that doesn’t have many of the problems of other errors like percentage errors.</p>
<p>Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) is another relative measure of error that is applicable only to time series data. It is defined as the mean absolute error of the model divided by the the mean absolute value of the first difference of the series. Thus, it measures the relative reduction in error compared to a naive model. Ideally its value will be significantly less than 1 but is relative to comparison across other models for the same series. Since this error measurement is relative and can be applied across models, it is accepted as one of the best metrics for error measurement.</p>
<p>Can use AIC for model selection. Also use confidence intervals.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.25</span> Naïve Bayes</h2>
<div id="intro-16" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.25.1</span> Intro</h3>
<p>Practitioners do use Naive Bayes regularly for ranking, where the actual values of the probabilities are not relevant—only the relative values for examples in the different classes. Another advantage of Naive Bayes is that it is naturally an “incremental learner.” An incremental learner is an induction technique that can update its model one training example at a time. It does not need to reprocess all past training examples when new training data become available.</p>
<p>Document/spam classification is one use. Assumptions are that all the features are equally likely and are all important. Would be computational expensive without these assumptions with having to track all the joint probabilities. Gaussian for continuous variables, Bernoulli for binary input, and Multinomial for binary and more input. Use MLE to estimate parameters for Gaussian. Bernoulli/Multinomial used for spam classification.The Laplace Estimator (usually chosen to be 1) is a corrective measure that adds a small amount of error to each of the counts in the frequency table of words. The addition of error ensures that each resulting probability of each event will necessarily be nonzero, even if the event did not appear in the training data.</p>
<p>Note: In addition, we can use function “partial_fit” to fit on a batch of samples incrementally while we are using. MultinomialNB and Bernoulli NB also support sample weighting.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.26.1</span> Intro</h3>
<p>Before we take a look into the inner workings of LDA in the following subsections, let’s summarize the key steps of the LDA approach:</p>
<p>Standardize the -dimensional dataset ( is the number of features).</p>
<p>For each class, compute the -dimensional mean vector.</p>
<p>Construct the between-class scatter matrix and the within-class scatter matrix .</p>
<p>Compute the eigenvectors and corresponding eigenvalues of the matrix .</p>
<p>Choose the eigenvectors that correspond to the largest eigenvalues to construct a -dimensional transformation matrix ; the eigenvectors are the columns of this matrix.</p>
<p>Project the samples onto the new feature subspace using the transformation matrix.</p>
<p>LDA similar to Naive Bayes but doesn’t assume variables are independent, assumes that p(x|y) is a multivariate normal distribution, and assumes gaussian distributions for each class share the same covariance matrix. If they don’t share the same covariance matrix, then we use Quadratic Discriminant Analysis which assumes each class has its own.</p>

<li><p>“Training with large minibatches is bad for your health. More importantly, it’s bad for your test error. Friends dont let friends use minibatches larger than 32.” - Yann Le Cun</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/deep-learning-cheat-sheet-25421411e460">DL Cheatsheet</a></p></li>
<li><p>By reducing learning rate (for example, to 0.001), Test loss drops to a value much closer to Training loss. In most runs, increasing Batch size does not influence Training loss or Test loss significantly. However, in a small percentage of runs, increasing Batch size to 20 or greater causes Test loss to drop slightly below Training loss.</p></li>
<li><p>Reducing the ratio of training to test data from 50% to 10% dramatically lowers the number of data points in the training set. With so little data, high batch size and high learning rate cause the training model to jump around chaotically (jumping repeatedly over the minimum point).</p></li>
<li><p>There are several activation functions you may encounter in practice:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sigmoid: Takes a real-valued input and squashes it to range between 0 and 1 (<span class="math inline">\(σ(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(−x))\)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>Softmax: Same end result as sigmoid, but different function.</p></li>
<li><p>tanh: Takes a real-valued input and squashes it to the range [-1, 1] (<span class="math inline">\(tanh(x) = 2σ(2x) − 1\)</span>)</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>ReLU: The rectified linear activation function (called ReLU) has been shown to lead to very high-performance networks. This function takes a single number as an input, returning 0 if the input is negative, and the input if the input is positive. <span class="math inline">\(f(x) = max(0, x)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>softmax doesn’t like multi-label classification</p></li>
<li><p>Embeddings vs One-Hot Encoding: Embeddings are better than One-Hot Encodings because it allows for relationships to be shown between days.</p></li>
<li><p>Advised to scale features</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqEYVzJLR_c&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=31">Rule of 30</a>: A change that affects at least 30 data points in your validation set is usually significant and not just noise.</p></li>
<li><p>Gradient descent takes about 3 times longer than the loss function. Stochastic gradient descent works off an estimate of the loss function from a sample of the training set. Scales better than normal gradient descent.</p></li>
<li><p>Momentum and learning rate decay are good for knowing which way to go in gradient descent.</p></li>
<li><p>Always try to lower your learning rate for improvement.</p></li>
<li><p>ADAGRAD is another optimization option that takes care of some of the hyperparameters for you.</p></li>
<li><p>n inputs and k outputs gives you <span class="math inline">\((n+1)*k\)</span> parameters.</p></li>
<li><p>Back propogation takes about twice the memory as forward propogation.</p></li>
<li><p>Stop model from overoptimizing on training set: early termination (stop as soon as performance on validation set drops) and regularization which applies artifical constraints to reduce the number of free parameters while making it difficult to optimize. Uses l2 regularization or dropout. Dropout works by randomly setting activations from one layer to the next to 0 repeatly. Forces the network to learn redundant representations, and takes average consensus for final prediction. Makes things more robust and prevents overfitting. Scale the non-zero activates by 2 to get the right average. If it doesn’t work, go deeper.</p></li>
<li><p>Two ways are to average the yellow, blue, and green channels or to use YUV representation. If position on the screen doesn’t matter then use translation invariance. Use weight sharing if this occurs in text.</p></li>
<li><p>Things that don’t chnage across time, space, etc are called statistical invariants.</p></li>
<li><p>RNN’s use shared parameters over time to extract patterns. Uses a recurrent connection to provide a summary of the past and pass this info to the classifier.</p></li>
<li><p>Backpropagation occurs throw time to the beginning. All derivative applied to same parameters, so very correlated. Bad for stochastic gradient descent and makes math very unstable. Gradients are either zero (doesn’t remember the past well) or infinity. The latter is fixed by gradient clipping and the former by LSTM (long-short term memory). LSTM replaced the rectified linear units by continuous functions. You can use dropout or L2 regularization with an LSTM.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally dealing with images, Convolutional Neural Network is used mostly because of its better accuracy results.</p></li>
<li><p>Model capacity: Same as underfitting and overfitting in bias-variance. Less nodes and hidden layers corresponds to simpler model and vice versa.</p></li>
<li><p>The perceptron is the simplest neural network. The perceptron is an iterative classification method.The perceptron starts with a random hyperplane then adjust its weights to separate the data.</p></li>
<li><p>BackProp Algorithm: Initially all the edge weights are randomly assigned. For every input in the training dataset, the ANN is activated and its output is observed. This output is compared with the desired output that we already know, and the error is “propagated” back to the previous layer. This error is noted and the weights are “adjusted” accordingly. This process is repeated until the output error is below a predetermined threshold.</p></li>
<li><p>The last layer of a neural network captures the most complex interactions.</p></li>
<li><p>When plotting the mean-squared error loss function against predictions, the slope is <span class="math inline">\(2x(y-xb)\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(2input_data error\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>weights_updated = weights - slope*learning_rate</p></li>
<li><p>This is exactly what’s happening in the vanishing gradient problem – the gradients of the network’s output with respect to the parameters in the early layers become extremely small. That’s a fancy way of saying that even a large change in the value of parameters for the early layers doesn’t have a big effect on the output.</p></li>
<li><p>Batch: Subset of the data used to calculate slopes during back propagation. Different batches are used to calculate different updates.</p></li>
<li><p>Epoch: One full pass through all the batches in the training data.</p></li>
<li><p>Stochastic gradient descent calculates slopes one batch at a time.</p></li>
<li><p>This network again uses the ReLU activation function, so the slope of the activation function is 1 for any node receiving a positive value as input.</p></li>
<li><p>Few people use kfold cv in deep learning because of the large datasets in play.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Linear SVM often outperforms logistic regression and is explainable as well.</p></li>
<li><p>However, the problem with cross-validation is that it is rarely applicable to real world problems, for all the reasons described in the above sections. Cross-validation only works in the same cases where you can randomly shuffle your data to choose a validation set.</p></li>
<li><p>If the performance of a classification model on the test set (out-of-sample) error is poor, you can’t just re-calibrate your model parameters to achieve a better model. This is cheating.</p></li>
<li><p>When the classes are well-separated, the parameter estimates for the logistic regression model are surprisingly unstable. Linear discriminant analysis does not suffer from this problem. If n is small and the distribution of the predictors X is approximately normal in each of the classes, the linear discriminant model is again more stable than the logistic regression model.</p></li>
<li><p>Roughly speaking, LDA tends to be a better bet than QDA if there are relatively few training observations and so reducing variance is crucial. In contrast, QDA is recommended if the training set is very large, so that the variance of the classifier is not a major concern, or if the assumption of a common covariance matrix for the K classes is clearly untenable.</p></li>
<li><p>Two features interact if the effect on the prediction of one feature depends on the value of the other feature</p></li>
<li><p>“No Free Lunch” theorem: no single classifier works best across all possible scenarios</p></li>
<li><p>Warning PolynomialFeatures(degree=d) transforms an array containing n features into an array containing features, where n! is the factorial of n, equal to 1 × 2 × 3 × ⋯ × n. Beware of the combinatorial explosion of the number of features!</p></li>
<li><p>If a model suffers from overfitting, we also say that the model has a high variance, which can be caused by having too many parameters that lead to a model that is too complex given the underlying data. Similarly, our model can also suffer from underfitting (high bias), which means that our model is not complex enough to capture the pattern in the training data well and therefore also suffers from low performance on unseen data.</p></li>
<li><p>It appears that each feature has modestly improved our model. There are certainly more features that we could add to our model. For example, we could add the day of the week and the hour of the posting, we could determine if the article is a listicle by running a regex on the headline, or we could examine the sentiment of each article. This only begins to touch on the features that could be important to model virality. We would certainly need to go much further to continue reducing the error in our model.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose Fixitol reduces symptoms by 20% over a placebo, but the trial you’re using to test it is too small to have adequate statistical power to detect this difference reliably. We know that small trials tend to have varying results; it’s easy to get 10 lucky patients who have shorter colds than usual but much harder to get 10,000 who all do.</p></li>
<li><p>As I mentioned earlier, one drawback of the Bonferroni correction is that it greatly decreases the statistical power of your experiments, making it more likely that you’ll miss true effects. More sophisticated procedures than Bonferroni correction exist, ones with less of an impact on statistical power, but even these are not magic bullets. Worse, they don’t spare you from the base rate fallacy. You can still be misled by your p threshold and falsely claim there’s “only a 5% chance I’m wrong.” Procedures like the Bonferroni correction only help you eliminate some false positives.</p></li>
<li><p>In step 1, we find where missing values are located. The md.pattern() function from the mice package is a really useful function. It gives you a clear view of where missing values are located, helping you in decisions regarding exclusions or substitution. You can refer to the next recipe for missing value substitution.</p></li>
<li><p>“Product classification is an example of multicategory or multinomial classification. Most classification problems and most classification algorithms are specialized for two-category, or binomial, classification. There are tricks to using binary classifiers to solve multicategory problems (for example, building one classifier for each category, called a “one versus rest” classifier). But in most cases it’s worth the effort to find a suitable multiple-category implementation, as they tend to work better than multiple binary classifiers (for example, using the package mlogit instead of the base method glm() for logistic regression).”</p></li>
<li><p>Another possible indication of collinearity in the inputs is seeing coefficients with an unexpected sign: for example, seeing that income is negatively correlated with years in the workforce.</p></li>
<li><p>The overall model can still predict income quite well, even when the inputs are correlated; it just can’t determine which variable deserves the credit for the prediction. Using regularization (especially ridge regression as found in lm.ridge() in the package MASS) is helpful in collinear situations (we prefer it to “x-alone” variable preprocessing, such as principal components analysis). If you want to use the coefficient values as advice as well as to make good predictions.</p></li>
<li><p>The degrees of freedom is thought of as the number of training data rows you have after correcting for the number of coefficients you tried to solve for. You want the degrees of freedom to be large compared to the number of coefficients fit to avoid overfitting.</p></li>
<li><p>Overfitting is when you find chance relations in your training data that aren’t present in the general population. Overfitting is bad: you think you have a good model when you don’t.</p></li>
<li><p>The probable reason for nonconvergence is separation or quasi-separation: one of the model variables or some combination of the model variables predicts the outcome perfectly for at least a subset of the training data. You’d think this would be a good thing, but ironically logistic regression fails when the variables are too powerful.</p></li>
<li><p>For categorical variables (male/female, or small/medium/large), you can define the distance as 0 if two points are in the same category, and 1 otherwise. If all the variables are categorical, then you can use Hamming distance, which counts the number of mismatches.</p></li>
<li><p>Your next step is to select a performance measure. A typical performance measure for regression problems is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). It measures the standard deviation of the errors the system makes in its predictions.</p></li>
<li><p>You should save every model you experiment with, so you can come back easily to any model you want. Make sure you save both the hyperparameters and the trained parameters, as well as the cross-validation scores and perhaps the actual predictions as well. This will allow you to easily compare scores across model types, and compare the types of errors they make. You can easily save Scikit-Learn models by using Python’s pickle module, or using sklearn.externals.joblib, which is more efficient at serializing large NumPy arrays.</p></li>
<li><p>If all classifiers are able to estimate class probabilities (i.e., they have a predict_proba() method), then you can tell Scikit-Learn to predict the class with the highest class probability, averaged over all the individual classifiers. This is called soft voting. It often achieves higher performance than hard voting because it gives more weight to highly confident votes. All you need to do is replace voting=“hard” with voting=“soft” and ensure that all classifiers can estimate class probabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>The standard value for k in k-fold cross-validation is 10, which is typically a reasonable choice for most applications. However, if we are working with relatively small training sets, it can be useful to increase the number of folds. If we increase the value of k, more training data will be used in each iteration, which results in a lower bias towards estimating the generalization performance by averaging the individual model estimates. However, large values of k will also increase the runtime of the cross-validation algorithm and yield estimates with higher variance since the training folds will be more similar to each other. On the other hand, if we are working with large datasets, we can choose a smaller value for k.</p></li>
<li><p>Distance Metrics: Hamming distance for categorical variables, Cosine distance for text data, Gower distance for categorical data</p></li>
<li><p>AIC x BIC: Explanatory power x Parsimonious</p></li>
<li><p>Bias is how far offon the average the model is from the truth. Variance is how much the estimate varies about its average. With low model complexity bias is high because predictions are more likely to stray from the truth, and variance is low because there are only few parameters being fit. With high model complexity bias is low because the model can adapt to more subtleties in the data, and variance is high because we have more parameters to estimate from the same amount of data.</p></li>
<li><p>The mean of highly correlated quantities has higher variance than the mean of uncorrelated quantities. The smaller the number of folds, the more biased the error estimates (they will be biased to be conservative indicating higher error than there is in reality) but the less variable they will be. On the extreme end you can have one fold for each data point which is known as Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation. In this case, your error estimate is essentially unbiased but it could potentially have high variance.</p></li>
<li><p>LDA vs Logistic Regression: When the classes are well-separated parameters of logistic regression are unstable and LDA doesn’t have this problem. If the distribution of X is approximately normal then LDA is more stable again. LDA doesn’t need to fit multiple models for multiclass classification.</p></li>
<li><p>SVM vs Logistic Regression: SVM is likely to overfit the data and can dominated LR on the training set. Kernel method makes SVM more flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>Decision Tree vs Linear Model: Tree has non-linear boundary, selects important features, easier to intepret but unstable especially for small data.</p></li>
<li><p>Naive Bayes vs LDA: Both use Bayes theorem, both assume gaussian distribution, but LDA takes care of the correlations. LDA might out-perform Naive Bayes when the features are highly correlated.</p></li>
<li><p>KNN vs Other Classification Methods: KNN is completely non-parametic, doesn’t tell which features are important. Dominates LDA and Logistic Regression when the decision boundary is highly non-linear.</p></li>
<li><p>When building, testing, and validating a suite of models, the optimal model (i.e., the optimal point in the ROC curve) is the spot where the overall accuracy of the model is essentially unchanged as we make small adjustments in the choice of model. That is to say, the change (from one model to the next) in the model’s precision (specificity) is exactly offset by the change in the model’s recall (sensitivity). Consequently, allowing for some imperfection, where the false positive rate and the false negative rate are in proper balance (so that neither one has too great of an impact on the overall accuracy and effectiveness of the model), is good fruit from your big data labors. The metric I used to guide my cross-validation is the F-score. This is a good metric when we have a lot more samples from one category than from the other categories.</p></li>
<li><p>The cost of the holdout method comes in the amount of data that is removed from the model training process. For instance, in the illustrative example here, we removed 30% of our data. This means that our model is trained on a smaller data set and its error is likely to be higher than if we trained it on the full data set. The standard procedure in this case is to report your error using the holdout set, and then train a final model using all your data.</p></li>
<li><p>A metric that minimizes false positives, by rarely flagging players and teams that fail to achieve the desired outcome, is specific. A metric that minimizes false negatives, by rarely failing to flag players and teams that achieve the desired outcome, is sensitive.</p></li>
<li><p>Although the previous code example was useful to illustrate how k-fold cross-validation works, scikit-learn also implements a k-fold cross-validation scorer, which allows us to evaluate our model using stratified k-fold cross-validation more efficiently</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes it may be more useful to report the coefficient of determination (), which can be understood as a standardized version of the MSE, for better interpretability of the model performance. In other words, is the fraction of response variance that is captured by the model. The value is defined as follows:Here, SSE is the sum of squared errors and SST is the total sum of squares , or in other words, it is simply the variance of the response.</p></li>
<li><p>Most people start working with data from exactly the wrong end. They begin with a data set, then apply their favorite tools and techniques to it. The result is narrow questions and shallow arguments. Starting with data, without first doing a lot of thinking, without having any structure, is a short road to simple questions and unsurprising results. We don’t want unsurprising—we want knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember that the positive class in scikit-learn is the class that is labeled as class 1. If we want to specify a different positive label, we can construct our own scorer via the make_scorer function, which we can then directly provide as an argument to the scoring parameter in GridSearchCV</p></li>
<li><p>While the weighted macro-average is the default for multiclass problems in scikit-learn, we can specify the averaging method via the average parameter inside the different scoring functions that we import from the sklean.metrics module, for example, the precision_score or make_scorer functions</p></li>
<li><p>Transforming words into feature vectorsTo construct a bag-of-words model based on the word counts in the respective documents, we can use the CountVectorizer class implemented in scikit-learn. As we will see in the following code section, the CountVectorizer class takes an array of text data, which can be documents or just sentences, and constructs the bag-of-words model for us:</p></li>
<li><p>Scikit-learn implements yet another transformer, the TfidfTransformer, that takes the raw term frequencies from CountVectorizer as input and transforms them into tf-idfs.</p></li>
<li><p>Naive Bayes is a linear classifier, while k-NN is not. The curse of dimensionality and large feature sets are a problem for k-NN, while Naive Bayes performs well. k-NN requires no training (just load in the dataset), whereas Naive Bayes does.</p></li>

<li><p>Less samples and more features increase the chance of overfitting.</p></li>
<li><p>You can choose either of the following inference strategies: offline inference, meaning that you make all possible predictions in a batch, using a MapReduce or something similar. You then write the predictions to an SSTable or Bigtable, and then feed these to a cache/lookup table. online inference, meaning that you predict on demand, using a server.</p></li>
<li><p>A static model is trained offline. That is, we train the model exactly once and then use that trained model for a while. A dynamic model is trained online. That is, data is continually entering the system and we’re incorporating that data into the model through continuous updates.</p></li>
<li><p>How would multiplying all of the predictions from a given model by 2.0 (for example, if the model predicts 0.4, we multiply by 2.0 to get a prediction of 0.8) change the model’s performance as measured by AUC? No change. AUC only cares about relative prediction scores. Yes, AUC is based on the relative predictions, so any transformation of the predictions that preserves the relative ranking has no effect on AUC. This is clearly not the case for other metrics such as squared error, log loss, or prediction bias (discussed later).</p></li>
<li><p>AUC is desirable for the following two reasons: AUC is scale-invariant. It measures how well predictions are ranked, rather than their absolute values. UC is classification-threshold-invariant. It measures the quality of the model’s predictions irrespective of what classification threshold is chosen. However, both these reasons come with caveats, which may limit the usefulness of AUC in certain use cases: Scale invariance is not always desirable. For example, sometimes we really do need well calibrated probability outputs, and AUC won’t tell us about that. Classification-threshold invariance is not always desirable. In cases where there are wide disparities in the cost of false negatives vs. false positives, it may be critical to minimize one type of classification error. For example, when doing email spam detection, you likely want to prioritize minimizing false positives (even if that results in a significant increase of false negatives). AUC isn’t a useful metric for this type of optimization.</p></li>
<li><p>Raising our classification threshold will cause the number of true positives to decrease or stay the same and will cause the number of false negatives to increase or stay the same. Thus, recall will either stay constant or decrease.</p></li>

<li><p>A feature cross is a synthetic feature formed by multiplying (crossing) two or more features. Crossing combinations of features can provide predictive abilities beyond what those features can provide individually.</p></li>
<li><p>Bias: Error Introduced by approximating real-life problem by using a simple method</p></li>
<li><p>Imagine a linear model with two strongly correlated features; that is, these two features are nearly identical copies of one another but one feature contains a small amount of random noise. If we train this model with L2 regularization, what will happen to the weights for these two features? L2 regularization will force the features towards roughly equivalent weights that are approximately half of what they would have been had only one of the two features been in the model.</p></li>
<li><p>L2 regularization will encourage many of the non-informative weights to be nearly (but not exactly) 0.0.</p></li>
<li><p>F1 Score = TP/(TP + FP + FN). Essentially how good you are at identifying the positive class.</p></li>
<li><p>Active Learning: Finding the optimal data to manually label</p></li>
<li><p>Simulated Annealing: Gradient descent extension</p></li>
<li><p>A variable that is completely useless by itself can provide a significant performance improvement when taken with others.</p></li>
<li><p>So, if your problem involves kind of searching a needle in the haystack when for ex: the positive class samples are very rare compared to the negative classes, use a precision recall curve. Otherwise use a ROC curve because a ROC curve remains the same regardless of the baseline prior probability of your positive class (the important rare class).</p></li>
<li><p>Variance: The amount the model output will change if the model was trained using a different data</p></li>
<li><p>Flexible Methods: higher variance, low bias, Example: KNN (k = 1)</p></li>
<li><p>Inflexible Methods: low variance, high bias, Example: Linear regression</p></li>
<li><p>Sequence mining Algorithms: spade, gsp, freespan; hmmlearn</p></li>
<li><p>Network models: graphical lasso, ising model, granger causality test, network hypothesis testing, bayesian networks</p></li>
<li><p>Parametric: Model has a function shape and form, Model is trained/fit using training data to determine parameter values, reduces the problem of training a model down to training a set of parameter values, Examples: linear regression</p></li>
<li><p>Non-Parametric: No assumption about model form is made, Example: KNN</p></li>
<li><p>Set Random state by hand in sklearn.</p></li>
<li><p>Generally need 3 rows of data per variable (to prevent model from seeing signal where there is only noise) [Nina Zumel]</p></li>
<li><p>Domain knowledge for feature selection and random forest feature importance (5-10) best variables. [Nina Zumel]</p></li>
<li><p>Because we have a couple thousand data points, even though salary can best be represented by a Poisson distribution, I’m going to use Gaussian distribution. (With bigger datasets, these two distribution start to become very similar).</p></li>
<li><p>We can also tell that our input, smart_1_normalized, doesn’t have a very strong relationship to our output because the standard error (0.009) is more than 1/10 of our estimate (0.02).</p></li>
<li><p>The less complex an ML model, the more likely that a good empirical result is not just due to the peculiarities of the sample.</p></li>
<li><p>The ML Fine Print: Three basic assumptions: 1) We draw examples independently and identically (i.i.d.) at random from the distribution, 2) The distribution is stationary: It doesn’t change over time, 3) We always pull from the same distribution: Including training, validation, and test sets. In practice, we sometimes violate these assumptions. For example: 1) Consider a model that chooses ads to display. The i.i.d. assumption would be violated if the model bases its choice of ads, in part, on what ads the user has previously seen. 2) Consider a data set that contains retail sales information for a year. User’s purchases change seasonally, which would violate stationarity. When we know that any of the preceding three basic assumptions are violated, we must pay careful attention to metrics.</p></li>
<li><p>empirical risk minimization: In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and attempting to find a model that minimizes loss.</p></li>
<li><p>Loss is the penalty for a bad prediction. That is, loss is a number indicating how bad the model’s prediction was on a single example. If the model’s prediction is perfect, the loss is zero; otherwise, the loss is greater.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.31.2</span> Unbalanced Classes</h3>
<p>Research on imbalanced classes often considers imbalanced to mean a minority class of 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>That said, here is a rough outline of useful approaches. These are listed approximately in order of effort:</p>
<p>Do nothing. Sometimes you get lucky and nothing needs to be done. You can train on the so-called natural (or stratified) distribution and sometimes it works without need for modification.</p>
<p>Balance the training set in some way: Oversample the minority class. Undersample the majority class. Synthesize new minority classes.</p>
<p>Throw away minority examples and switch to an anomaly detection framework.</p>
<p>At the algorithm level, or after it: Adjust the class weight (misclassification costs). Adjust the decision threshold. Modify an existing algorithm to be more sensitive to rare classes.</p>
<p>Construct an entirely new algorithm to perform well on imbalanced data.</p>
<p>Use AUC, F1 Score, Cohen’s Kappa, ROC curve, a precision-recall curve, a lift curve, or a profit (gain) curve for evaluation.</p>
<p>Use probability estimates and not the default .5 threshold.</p>
<p>Undersampling, oversampling, increase weight of minority class</p>
<p>Decision trees often perform well on imbalanced datasets because their hierarchical structure allows them to learn signals from both classes.</p>
<p>Reframe as Anomaly Detection</p>
<ul>
<li>Sklearn Eg: wclf = svm.SVC(kernel=‘linear’, class_weight={1: 10}) &amp; svm.SVC(kernel=‘linear’, class_weight=‘balanced’)</li>

<li><p>Account for longitudinal data: random selection of one event from each student, partition cross validation by dates, pca finds major trends hidden within the data</p></li>
