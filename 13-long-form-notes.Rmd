# Notes

* Active Learning: Finding the optimal data to manually label

* Simulated Annealing: Gradient descent extension

* "No Free Lunch" theorem: no single classifier works best across all possible scenarios

* So, if your problem involves kind of searching a needle in the haystack when for ex: the positive class samples are very rare compared to the negative classes, use a precision recall curve. Otherwise use a ROC curve because a ROC curve remains the same regardless of the baseline prior probability of your positive class (the important rare class).

* Sequence mining Algorithms: spade, gsp, freespan; hmmlearn 

* Network models: graphical lasso, ising model, granger causality test, network hypothesis testing, bayesian networks

* Parametric: Model has a function shape and form, Model is trained/fit using training data to determine parameter values, reduces the problem of training a model down to training a set of parameter values, Examples: linear regression. Non-Parametric: No assumption about model form is made, Example: KNN

* The ML Fine Print: Three basic assumptions: 1) We draw examples independently and identically (i.i.d.) at random from the distribution, 2) The distribution is stationary: It doesn't change over time, 3) We always pull from the same distribution: Including training, validation, and test sets. In practice, we sometimes violate these assumptions. For example: 1) Consider a model that chooses ads to display. The i.i.d. assumption would be violated if the model bases its choice of ads, in part, on what ads the user has previously seen. 2) Consider a data set that contains retail sales information for a year. User's purchases change seasonally, which would violate stationarity. When we know that any of the preceding three basic assumptions are violated, we must pay careful attention to metrics.

* empirical risk minimization: In supervised learning, a machine learning algorithm builds a model by examining many examples and attempting to find a model that minimizes loss.

* Loss is the penalty for a bad prediction. That is, loss is a number indicating how bad the model's prediction was on a single example. If the model's prediction is perfect, the loss is zero; otherwise, the loss is greater. 

* If a model suffers from overfitting, we also say that the model has a high variance, which can be caused by having too many parameters that lead to a model that is too complex given the underlying data. Similarly, our model can also suffer from underfitting (high bias), which means that our model is not complex enough to capture the pattern in the training data well and therefore also suffers from low performance on unseen data.

* "Product classification is an example of multicategory or multinomial classification. Most classification problems and most classification algorithms are specialized for two-category, or binomial, classification. There are tricks to using binary classifiers to solve multicategory problems (for example, building one classifier for each category, called a “one versus rest” classifier). But in most cases it’s worth the effort to find a suitable multiple-category implementation, as they tend to work better than multiple binary classifiers (for example, using the package mlogit instead of the base method glm() for logistic regression)."
