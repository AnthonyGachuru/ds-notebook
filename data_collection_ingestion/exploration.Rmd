## General

[Optimal Bins For Histogram](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/798/calculating-optimal-number-of-bins-in-a-histogram/862#862)

**The Coefficient of Unalikeability**: (Unalikeability is defined as how often observations differ from one another). It varies from 0 to 1. The higher the value, the more unalike the data are.

## SQL

Reconcile table data by joining and matching
Explain differences between relational databases (tabular data storage) and document-based databases (key-value pairs)
Collect data using standard sql commands [Select, From, Insert, Update, Delete, Create, Drop, Truncate]
Create relationships between tables and data including has_many and many_to_many with join tables using Joins [‘left’, ‘right’, ‘inner’, ‘full’, and ‘union’]
Use union and union_all to collect data
Explain the differences between null vs. 0
Use sql conditional operators [=,!=,>,<,IN and BETWEEN] and Null functions[‘is Null’, ‘ is not Null’ and ‘NVL’ ] to create boolean statements
Use sql mathematical functions [ABS, SIGN, MOD, FLOOR, CEILING, ROUND, SQRT] to clean data
Use CASE statements to clean and analyze data
handle null values in excel/sql
stat methods in excel and sql
agg n math funcs in excel/sql, window function & lag
SQL: select, update, delete, insert, create + set, case, decode + how to deal with nulls sql
A schema is a blueprint for storing data. For a table every row has same number of columns, and each column is of the same type.

## Missingness & Imputation

* Missingness types: 1) Completely at Random, 2) At Random, 3) Not at random

The pros of imputation:

* Helps retain a larger sample size of your data.
* Does not sacrifice all the available information in an observation because of sparse missingness.

* Can potentially avoid unwanted bias.

The cons of imputation:

* The standard errors of any estimates made during analyses following imputation can tend to be too small.

* The methods are under the assumption that all measurements are actually “known,” when in fact some were imputed.
* Can potentially induce unwanted bias.
